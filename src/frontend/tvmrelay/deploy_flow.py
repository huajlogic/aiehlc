"""Deploy a real ONNX ResNet-18 through Relay to a board ELF, stage by stage.

    ensure_tvm016()  ->  download resnet18-v1-7.onnx  ->  Relay
                     ->  int8 quantize  ->  target="c" codegen
                     ->  per-layer folders  ->  baremetal aarch64 main.elf
                     ->  CPU reference classification

Seven stages, matching the seven things this flow has to prove:

1. **Environment** — ``onnx_compat.ensure_tvm016()`` guarantees TVM 0.16 with a
   working ``tvm.relay`` (Relay was removed in the Relax transition, so the
   modern TVM in ``src/frontend/tvm`` cannot do this at all), and
   ``ensure_onnx_mapping()`` restores the ``onnx.mapping`` module that onnx 1.16
   deleted and TVM 0.16 still imports. Both come from importing the package.

2. **Import** — fetch the pretrained ImageNet ResNet-18 (opset 7, 46 MB) and run
   ``relay.frontend.from_onnx``. The 99 initializers arrive as inline
   ``relay.Constant`` nodes, *not* in the returned ``params`` dict (which comes
   back empty even under ``freeze_params=True``), so anything wanting weights
   must read them out of the graph.

3. **Quantize** — int8 PTQ **in ONNX**, before Relay sees the graph
   (``onnx_ptq.py``): symmetric per-channel int8 weights + **asymmetric**
   activations, covering every conv *including the first* and the input image
   itself. The quantized QDQ model is then imported and run through
   ``FakeQuantizationToInteger`` so the graph is genuinely integer rather than
   ``dequantize -> fp32 op -> quantize``.

   The quantization itself needs no LLVM (it happens in onnxruntime), but the
   build still does: ``FakeQuantizationToInteger`` calls ``FoldConstantExpr``
   directly (``fake_quantization_to_integer.py:35``), which
   ``disabled_pass=["FoldConstant"]`` cannot reach, so codegen on a
   ``USE_LLVM=OFF`` build dies with ``target.build.llvm is not enabled``
   *after* stage 3 has already succeeded.

   ``--relay-ptq`` selects the older ``relay.quantize`` path instead. It is
   symmetric-only -- its annotation op is
   ``simulated_quantize(data, scale, clip_min, clip_max)``, with no zero-point
   anywhere -- and it leaves an fp32 head and tail
   (``skip_conv_layers=[0]``, ``skip_dense_layer=True``). It is also **gated on
   LLVM**: see the note below; when the gate is shut the stage is skipped and
   the flow continues in fp32 rather than emitting something mislabelled as
   int8.

   The ONNX path currently produces a *larger* ELF (~24 MB vs ~14 MB) because
   conv **operands are stored int16**. The values are genuine int8; only the
   storage width is not. It is still the default because it quantizes the
   whole network and preserves the fp32 top-5 ordering, which the symmetric
   path does not.

   The int16 is **not** the generic legalization -- that one returns ``None``.
   ``Target("c")`` carries ``keys=['cpu']``, so the **Intel** registration
   ``_qnn_conv2d_legalize_intel_cpu`` is what fires
   (``qnn/op/legalizations.py:520``); its gate ``is_fast_int8_on_intel()`` is
   ``target_has_features("sse4.2")``, false for a C-source target, so it takes
   ``helper_no_fast_int8_hw_legalization``, which casts **data and kernel** to
   int16 and subtracts the zero-points eagerly. Registering a ``"cpu"``
   legalization that returns ``None`` instead reaches
   ``QnnConv2DCanonicalize``, whose four-term expansion keeps uint8 x int8 and
   folds the zero-points into the bias. Measured: output **bit-identical**
   (top1 258, logit 12.017338), params 23.5 -> 11.9 MB, local ELF 24.3 -> 12.6
   MB, ~7% faster -- against 30 -> 120 graph nodes, 28 -> 59 kernels, and 0.1
   -> 5.1 MB of int32 scratch for the zero-point reduction terms. Not wired to
   a flag.

4. **Codegen** — ``relay.build(target="c")`` and write the C source + header,
   then ``gcc -fsyntax-only`` it (TVM can emit C that does not compile).

5. **Split** — one folder per layer under ``layers/``, in graph execution
   order, so each layer has a working directory for its AIE artifacts
   (``split_layers.py``).

6. **ARM** — link a baremetal aarch64 ``main.elf`` for the board
   (``arm_build.py``). The generated C is kernels only -- no ``main``, no
   weights in memory, nothing calling the kernels in order -- so that module
   generates the graph driver, a small TVM runtime shim, and an entry point,
   then links them with the cortexa78 BSP using the same recipe as
   ``script/hostcompile.sh``. Needs ``source script/setup.sh --path-set-only``
   for the cross toolchain; without it the stage reports and is skipped.

   The image the ELF classifies is baked in as ``input_image.h``: a real photo
   (the pytorch/hub dog by default, ``--image`` for another) run through the
   standard ImageNet preprocessing, plus ``imagenet_labels.h`` so the board
   prints "Samoyed" rather than "class 258". Preprocessing is *called*, not
   reimplemented -- ``example/model/resnet18py/classify.py:preprocess`` -- so
   the board and the CPU reference cannot disagree over normalization.

   **``--local``** links the *same* generated C into ``main_local.elf`` for
   this host instead (``make local``) and runs it, so the top-5 can be diffed
   against stage 7 in seconds rather than by flashing a board. It needs no
   Vitis toolchain -- it composes with ``--no-arm`` -- and it is not the cross
   build with a different ``-mcpu``: the BSP and the baremetal link recipe are
   dropped, and two flags have to be *added*, ``-D__AIESIM__`` (so
   ``aie_timer.h`` takes its portable ``clock_gettime`` branch rather than
   including the BSP's ``xtime_l.h``) and ``-std=gnu11`` instead of
   ``-std=c11`` (``CLOCK_MONOTONIC`` is POSIX, which strict ISO mode hides).
   An AIE-offloaded build cannot be linked here and says so.

   **``make TRACE=1``** compiles in the generated driver's per-node
   instrumentation, which this stage emits behind ``#ifdef GRAPH_TRACE`` on
   every build -- a normal build carries none of it. Two dumps per tensor:
   the first few DECODED elements to the console, and **every kernel input and
   output in full** as a compilable C header of hex bytes, one file per tensor
   per call, into ``layeriohex/`` next to the running ELF (so ``--local`` fills
   ``arm_build/layeriohex/``). ``TRACE_HEX=0`` drops the headers,
   ``TRACE_HEX_MAX=N`` caps each at N bytes. Only the hosted build writes
   files; a baremetal board has no filesystem, so there the identical text
   streams over the console between ``===BEGIN layeriohex/...===`` markers and
   ``arm_build.split_layeriohex(log)`` cuts it back into the same files.
   Instrumenting a node therefore never means editing ``graph_driver.c`` --
   that file is rewritten on every run of this script.

   **AIE offload** (``--aie-offload``, off by default) puts the selected
   layers (``--aie-layers``, default 6 = the 7x7/s2 conv stem; it was 1 before
   int8 legalization split each conv into a zero-point chain and renumbered
   ``layers/``) on the AIE through
   TVM BYOC: the convs are partitioned out of the Relay graph, the C is
   rebuilt, and the graph executor calls the generated wrapper -> the aiehlc
   library ``aout/libconv2dstem.a`` in their place. The library is built
   separately (``source script/aiehlc.sh --aie-version 5 --runtime-source-file
   src/aietensorop/conv2dstem/conv2dstem.cc``); aiehlc generates its device
   init / mesh partition / launch. Offload is blind: no tile-budget check on
   this side. See ``aie_offload.py`` and ``byoc/``.

   **Whole-graph aiegraph** (``--aiegraph``) is the other way in: it lifts the
   *entire* graph into one ``aiegraph.func`` whose SSA edges are the model's
   real dataflow, then **partitions** it -- layers that are in ``--aie-layers``
   *and* whose aiegraph ops are all in ``--aiegraph-ops`` (default the conv2d
   family) go to the aiehlc kernel backend, and every other
   layer **reuses the TVM-generated CPU C** from stage 5 unchanged. Every layer
   gets a verdict and a reason in ``layers/partition.json``, including the ones
   the 4-op dialect cannot express (``max_pool2d``, ``batch_flatten``). The
   whole graph is lifted and verified regardless of the selection -- it only
   decides which verified layers get an ``aie/`` build, so ``--aie-layers``
   means the same thing here as under ``--aie-offload`` and both default to the
   conv stem at layer 6. See ``aiegraph_partition.py``.

7. **CPU** — classify the same image with onnxruntime on the same folded ONNX
   and print the top-5. This is the answer the ELF has to reproduce, from an
   **independent** implementation rather than a second call into the generated
   C, so matching means the compile path is right rather than self-consistent.
   The ELF prints the same five lines in the same format, logits included --
   a class index alone would hide the small numeric drift a miscompiled kernel
   actually produces.

Two host-specific fixups this flow has to make, both load-bearing:

``target_has_feature``
    ``topi.x86.dense_alter_op`` calls ``target_has_features(["avx512bw", ...])``
    during legalization, which reaches an FFI symbol that only exists in an
    LLVM-enabled build. Without a shim *any* ``relay.build(target="c")`` dies
    with ``AttributeError: module 'tvm.target._ffi_api' has no attribute
    'target_has_feature'`` — even for a two-line dense model, and even at
    ``opt_level=0``. ``_shim_target_features()`` answers False (no AVX-512),
    which is the right answer for a C-source target anyway.

``FoldConstant`` needs LLVM
    ``relay.quantize`` calls ``prerequisite_optimize`` ->  ``FoldConstant``,
    which *JIT-executes* constant subgraphs against a target hardcoded as
    ``Target eval_cpu_target_{"llvm"}`` (``src/relay/transforms/fold_constant.cc:403``)
    — not overridable from Python. On a ``USE_LLVM=OFF`` build that raises
    ``target.build.llvm is not enabled``. Disabling ``FoldConstant`` does not
    help: calibration then asserts on ``isinstance(expr.args[0], Constant)``
    (``_calibrate.py:154``), because it *requires* folded constants. So int8
    quantization is genuinely unavailable without LLVM, and this module reports
    that rather than pretending. ``llvm_status()`` is the single predicate.

    ``fuse=False`` gives one kernel per Relay op instead of per fused group --
    a real ``relu`` kernel, a real ``add`` kernel -- which is what stage 5
    needs to emit genuinely per-op layer files. It is slower code: fusion
    exists to keep intermediates in registers.

    Note it is **not** implemented as ``disabled_pass=["FuseOps"]``. FuseOps
    does two jobs -- grouping ops, and wrapping each group in a primitive
    ``Function`` -- and the graph executor codegen needs the second one
    unconditionally (``graph_executor_codegen.cc:452``:
    ``Expected the operator to be a global var, but got Op``). Instead we run
    ``FuseOps(fuse_opt_level=0)`` ourselves, which short-circuits at
    ``graph_partitioner.cc:104`` after ``InitGroups`` so every node is its own
    group, still wrapped -- then disable the build's own FuseOps so it cannot
    re-fuse what we just split.

    ``target="c"`` emits portable C rather than machine code, so it needs no
    LLVM -- with two caveats, both of which bite on a ``USE_LLVM=OFF`` build:

    * the FFI shims from stage 1 are required to get past x86 legalization;
    * ``target_host`` must be set to ``"c"`` explicitly. It defaults to
      ``llvm``, and the *host* module is built separately from the operator
      modules, so leaving it implicit fails in ``TIRToRuntime`` with
      ``target.build.llvm is not enabled`` even though every kernel compiled;
    * ``NO_LLVM_DISABLED_PASSES`` must be dropped (only when LLVM is absent --
      with LLVM they are kept, since they make the output faster);
    * ``tir.disable_vectorize`` is required for the C to *compile*. TVM's x86
      schedules vectorize, and the C backend renders a 16-lane int32 as the
      type ``int32_t16``, which is not a C type -- gcc rejects it with
      ``unknown type name 'int32_t16'``. The emitted file looks fine and is
      only caught by actually compiling it, so ``verify_c`` does.

    """Run all seven stages. Returns a dict of what happened.

    ``aie_offload`` offloads ``aie_layers`` (stage-5 layer indices; ``None``
    means every eligible layer) to AIE through TVM BYOC: after the CPU build,
    the selected convs are partitioned out of the Relay graph and the C is
    rebuilt, so the graph executor calls the generated wrapper -> the aiehlc
    AIE library in place of TVM's own kernel (``_stage_aie_offload``). It also
    runs the ``aiegraph`` lift below over the same selection, which is what
    writes ``layers/NN_op/aie/`` -- BYOC itself writes no per-layer artifacts.

    ``aiegraph`` instead lifts the **whole** graph into one verified
    ``aiegraph.func`` and partitions it: layers in ``aie_layers`` whose aiegraph
    ops are all in ``aiegraph_ops`` are offloaded to the aiehlc kernel backend,
    and the rest reuse the TVM-generated CPU C. Also additive. ``aie_layers`` is
    the **same** selection ``aie_offload`` uses -- both default to layer 6, the
    7x7/s2 conv stem under the int8-legalized graph -- so the two ways in target
    the same conv instead of one offloading a layer and the other the graph.

    **Quantizer.** Stage 3 defaults to ONNX PTQ (``onnx_ptq.py``): the model is
    quantized *before* Relay sees it, giving symmetric per-channel int8 weights
    and **asymmetric** activations, and covering every conv including the first
    plus the input image itself. ``relay_ptq=True`` selects the older
    ``relay.quantize`` path instead -- symmetric-only, and it leaves an fp32
    head and tail (``skip_conv_layers=[0]``, ``skip_dense_layer=True``). See
    ``quantize_int8`` for what that costs and why it needs LLVM.
    ``skip_quantize`` overrides both and emits fp32.

    ``fold_qnn_zp`` (on; ``--no-fold-qnn-zp`` opts out) collapses each conv's
    all-equal per-channel kernel zero point to a rank-0 scalar so TVM's own
    four-term elision fires. Output-preserving, and it removes the dead
    ``cast_sum -> multiply -> avg_pool2d -> repeat_multiply`` chains: measured
    **120 -> 41 kernel calls** on int8 ResNet-18. See ``qnn_fold_zp.py``.

    ``local`` additionally links the same generated C into ``main_local.elf``
    for *this* host and runs it, so stage 6's output can be checked against
    stage 7's reference without a board. It needs no Vitis toolchain, so it
    composes with ``arm=False``; it cannot link an AIE-offloaded build.

    #
    # This used to auto-disable under --aie-offload / --aiegraph, because int8
    # legalization restructures the graph (30 -> 120 nodes) and renumbers
    # `layers/` -- the ResNet stem moves from index 1 to 6 -- while
    # `--aie-layers` was read as a position into the Relay graph. That guard is
    # obsolete: selection now resolves a layer to its conv by WEIGHT FINGERPRINT
    # (`byoc.aie_annotate.weight_fingerprint` -- sorted values hashed as int64),
    # which is layout- and dtype-independent by construction, and
    # `check_targets` demands exactly one Relay conv matching both the
    # fingerprint and the geometry before anything is offloaded. Verified: the
    # same weights hash identically as int8/NCHW, int16/NCHW and int16/NCHWc.
    # `--aiegraph` now takes the same `--aie-layers` selection (it used to take
    # none), so both ways in target the same conv: layer 1, the stem.
    #
    # Keeping it off was also the wrong default on its own terms: the AIE kernel
    # consumes int8, so legalizing to int16 meant the offloaded conv's operands
    # were the one thing NOT in the width the hardware wants.
    #
    # `--aie-layers` indices DO still move with any pass that adds or removes
    # graph nodes -- the stem has been index 1 (fp32), then 6 (int8 legalized),
    # then 1 again (int8 + the qnn zero-point fold, today's default). That was
    # never the thing protecting correctness: a wrong index that lands on a
    # non-conv reports "not a conv -- only convs offload" and offloads nothing.
    # It does NOT protect against landing on a DIFFERENT conv, which resolves
    # fine and then matches no pattern -- check the geometry the stage prints.

    # `--aiegraph` maps layers by fused op list (`conv2d` present -> conv_bn /

    # because the int8 graph is 5-D NCHWc and its geometry reader took 4-D only
    # ("non-4D shapes; not a conv2d"); it now folds NCHWc via
    # aie_offload._layer_geometry, so all 20 convs lift and layer 1 (the stem,
