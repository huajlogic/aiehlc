"""Step 2 of the BYOC flow: SELECT which fused composites go to the AIE.

The second of the four BYOC files. ``AnnotateTarget`` offloads everything that
matches; ``--aie-offload --aie-layers`` asks for specific layers, so this pass
inserts ``compiler_begin``/``compiler_end`` itself, around the composites whose
conv was selected. ``MergeCompilerRegions`` + ``PartitionGraph`` then work as
usual.

Two questions, asked in this order
----------------------------------
1. *Did the user ask for this layer?* -- its ``aie.weight_fp`` tag (stamped by
   ``aie_fuse``) is in ``selected``.
2. *Can the kernel run it?* -- ``aie_patterns.kernel_can_run``, which returns a
   reason.

Keeping these apart is the whole point of the fuse/select split. Fusion is now
geometry-agnostic, so a layer that the AIE cannot take still becomes a composite
and still reaches this pass, where it is turned down BY NAME and inlined back.
Before the split the geometry gate sat in the ``MergeComposite`` checker, so
such a layer never fused, "malformed" and "not the stem" were the same silence,
and the inline-back path below was unreachable code.

A conv is identified by its WEIGHTS, not its position
-----------------------------------------------------
Relay's post-order and the graph executor's order are NOT the same: in every
ResNet downsampling block TVM fuses the 1x1 shortcut conv with the residual
add, so it runs after the main branch, while Relay's post-order visits it
first (convs 5-7, 10-12, 15-17 swap -- measured). Any "n-th conv" numbering is
therefore wrong on one side. ``weight_fingerprint`` -- a hash of the SORTED
weight values -- is layout-independent (the CPU build stores the same weights
as NCHWc-blocked int16) and unique for all 20 ResNet-18 convs, so
``aie_offload.resolve_conv_targets`` selects by it.

The boundary goes on the composite function, not on individual operators
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
``compiler_begin`` wraps the composite's inputs and ``compiler_end`` its output.
Marking individual operators inside it would tear the fused kernel apart again.
