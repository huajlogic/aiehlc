"""Lift the **whole** Relay graph into aiegraph IR, then partition AIE vs CPU.

This is the ``--aiegraph`` path, and it does the two things in that order:

1. **Lift every layer** it can onto an ``aiegraph`` op, building one
   ``aiegraph.func`` whose SSA def-use edges are the model's real dataflow.
2. **Partition**: ops in ``aie_ops`` (default the conv2d family, which is all
   ``run_aie_pipeline`` has a kernel body for) are offloaded to the aiehlc
   backend; every other layer **reuses the TVM-generated C** from stage 5,
   untouched.

Contrast with ``aie_offload.py``, which is index-selected and only ever looks at
the layers you name. This module always walks the whole graph, so the output is
a complete accounting: every layer gets a verdict and a reason.

Why the IR is built over graph *nodes*, not manifest layers
-----------------------------------------------------------
``layers/manifest.json`` has one entry per **distinct generated symbol** (22 for
ResNet-18), but the graph invokes 24 -- two kernels run twice, because the two
64ch/56x56 blocks are shape-identical and TVM emits one function for each pair.
Dataflow lives on the nodes, not the symbols, so the IR is built by walking
``graph["nodes"]`` in execution order. Layer folders are then keyed back by
symbol, and a folder reused by two nodes gets **one** set of AIE artifacts --
the invocations are the same kernel at the same shape, so the artifacts would
be byte-identical.

(Note this is exactly what ``aie_offload.select_layers`` gets wrong: it zips
manifest index *i* against ``call_nodes[i]`` positionally, which desynchronizes
at the first repeated symbol and hands every later layer another layer's
geometry. ``_nodes_by_symbol`` here maps by name instead.)

Op mapping
----------
The dialect has four ops; the fused TVM layer kinds map on like this::

    conv2d_add_relu      -> conv_bn_relu
    conv2d_add           -> conv_bn
    conv2d_add_add_relu  -> conv_bn + residual_add_relu   (two ops, one layer)
    global_avg_pool2d               \\_ folded into one avgpool_fc
      + dense_add                   /
    max_pool2d           -> (none)  CPU: no aiegraph op
    batch_flatten        -> (none)  CPU: dead kernel, the graph elides it

A layer is offloaded only when **every** aiegraph op it expands to is in
``aie_ops``. That is why ``conv2d_add_add_relu`` stays on the CPU even though
its conv half is eligible: the generated C is one fused function computing
conv+bias+residual+relu, so there is no seam to split it at. Claiming the layer
for AIE would mean the residual never runs.

Gaps are expected, not errors
-----------------------------
A layer with no aiegraph op (``max_pool2d``) breaks the SSA chain: its consumer
has no producer to reference, so ``build_aiegraph_module`` materializes a fresh
block argument (``main_index=-1``, a network input). The IR still verifies, and
the discontinuity is recorded in ``partition.json`` rather than papered over --
which is the point, since each offloaded layer is launched standalone anyway
(the APU owns the buffers between launches).

**The block args do not alias.** Two consumers of the same CPU-produced tensor
each get their *own* block argument, because ``-1`` is the only way to say "not
from an aiegraph op" across the pybind boundary and it allocates a fresh one
every time. ResNet-18 shows this at the pool: ``%1`` reads ``%arg1`` and the
first residual's skip reads ``%arg2``, though both are really node 4's output.
So the IR is faithful about *which ops run where* and about every edge between
two aiegraph ops, but it under-shares at the CPU boundary. Nothing downstream
depends on that -- launches are standalone and the APU owns the buffers -- and
fixing it would mean teaching ``build_aiegraph_module`` to reference an existing
block argument by index.
