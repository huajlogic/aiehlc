"""Link the generated ResNet-18 C into a baremetal aarch64 ELF for the board.

``relay.build(target="c")`` gives kernels but no program: there is no ``main``,
no weights in memory, and no code calling the kernels in order. TVM normally
supplies that from its graph *runtime* (C++, host-side). This module generates
the missing pieces from ``resnet18_graph.json`` instead, so the result is plain
C that the aiehlc aarch64 toolchain can link:

    layers/NN_op/NN_op.c one kernel per operator       (stage 5)
      -> NN_op.o -> liblayers.a                                        <- here
    tvm_runtime_shim.c   the ~4 TVM runtime symbols the kernels call   <- here
    graph_driver.c       storage plan + kernel calls in graph order    <- here
    main.c               entry point, weight load, argmax, timing      <- here
    weights.bin          resnet18_params.bin, linked via ld -r         <- here
    Makefile             the build recipe                              <- here
      -> make -> main.elf

**Kernels come from the per-layer split by default.** Stage 5 writes one
translation unit per operator under ``<out>/layers/``; each is compiled to a
``.o`` *beside its source* and archived into ``liblayers.a``. That is what
makes a single operator independently rebuildable -- editing one layer
recompiles one TU, not a 536 KB module -- and it is the natural place for a
layer's AIE artifacts to sit next to the C they replace.

The monolithic ``resnet18.c`` remains the fallback, used when stage 5 was
skipped (``--no-split``). Exactly one of the two is wired into the Makefile,
so no kernel is ever compiled twice. Measured difference on ResNet-18 int8:
1,312,864 vs 1,312,608 bytes of .text (+0.02%, slightly less cross-TU
inlining), same 65 ``tvmgen_*`` symbols.

**Python generates; make builds.** Everything above is written to
``<out>/arm_build/``, then ``make`` is invoked on the generated Makefile --
the same one a person re-runs by hand after editing a source, without going
back through Python:

    make -C worklocal/tvmrelay_deploy/arm_build            # rebuild changed
    make -C ... clean && make -C ...                       # from scratch
    make -C ... CROSS=aarch64-linux-gnu- CPU=cortex-a72    # retarget

``--no-make`` stops after generating, which is also what happens automatically
when the cross toolchain is not on PATH.

**The same sources also build for this host** -- ``make local`` (or
``--local`` here and in ``deploy_flow.py``) links ``main_local.elf`` with the
host gcc and runs it, so the graph's top-5 can be diffed against the
onnxruntime reference without flashing a board. It is not the cross build with
a different ``-mcpu``: the BSP and the whole baremetal link recipe are dropped,
and two flags have to be *added* -- ``-D__AIESIM__`` so ``aie_timer.h`` takes
its portable ``clock_gettime`` branch instead of including the BSP's
``xtime_l.h``, and ``-std=gnu11`` rather than ``-std=c11`` because
``CLOCK_MONOTONIC`` is POSIX and strict ISO mode hides it. An AIE-offloaded
build cannot be linked here and says so (the archives are aarch64, and their
kernels run on the array).

**Why not TVM's AOT executor.** ``Executor("aot")`` does emit a real
``tvmgen_default_run`` entry point, which looks like exactly the right answer.
It was tried and rejected: AOT inlines every weight into the C source as
initializer text, which for ResNet-18 is a **188 MB** .c file. That is not
compilable in practice, and ``link-params=False`` does not prevent it. Reading
the weights from a binary blob at runtime keeps the source at ~340 KB and the
weights in ``.rodata`` where they belong.

**Toolchain.** Reuses the same recipe as ``script/hostcompile.sh`` and
``quant/build_demo.build_aarch64``: ``aarch64-none-elf-gcc``, ``-mcpu=cortex-a78``,
the cortexa78 BSP under ``thirdparty/arch/``, ``--specs=nosys.specs``, and the
BSP linker script. ``script/setup.sh --path-set-only`` must have been sourced;
``toolchain_status()`` reports whether it was, and the build is skipped with an
explanation rather than a traceback when it was not.

**No AIE yet.** This links the CPU path only -- ``aie_runtime.c``, ``routing.cc``
and an embedded kernel ELF are what ``hostcompile.sh`` adds, and none of them
exist for these layers yet. When a layer folder grows a ``.bcf`` and a kernel,
that layer's call site here is what changes.

Memory: the graph needs a 52 MB workspace and 46 MB of weights, against the
2 GB of DDR the BSP linker script maps. Both are checked at generation time.

#   -std=gnu11     NOT -std=c11. clock_gettime/CLOCK_MONOTONIC are POSIX, and
#                  strict ISO mode hides them -- the compile dies with
#                  "'CLOCK_MONOTONIC' undeclared" inside aie_timer.h.
#   -lm            the BSP supplied libm via -lxil's group; here it is explicit.

# baremetal link recipe (--specs=nosys.specs, --defsym end=, -T lscript.ld).
# None of them mean anything to a hosted x86 link.
#
# Objects go in localobj/ with flattened names, so a local build never
# clobbers the cross objects (the layer .o sit next to their .c, and those are
# aarch64). The directory is NOT called `local`: that is the phony target's

# build carries none of it. TRACE_ELEMS=N changes how many elements each dump
# shows (default 8).
#
# This is why instrumenting a node does NOT mean editing graph_driver.c: that
# file is regenerated by deploy_flow.py and hand edits are overwritten.
#
# TRACE=1 ALSO writes every kernel input and output out in full as a C header
# of hex bytes -- one file per tensor per call, into ./layeriohex/ relative to
# wherever the ELF runs (so `make local run-local` fills arm_build/layeriohex/).
# TRACE_HEX=0 keeps the console trace but drops the headers; TRACE_HEX_MAX=N

# traced call reads). TRACE_HEX_PARAMS=0 drops the second set -- it is the
# expensive one, since the whole 11.9 MB blob in hex is ~72 MB.

# `arm_build/` — the generated program around TVM's kernels

Generated by `src/frontend/tvmrelay/arm_build.py`. **Do not edit by hand** —
every file here is rewritten by the next `deploy_flow.py` or `arm_build.py`
run, including this README. Change the generator instead.

`relay.build(target="c")` gives kernels but not a program: no `main`, no
weights in memory, nothing calling the kernels in order. This folder is the
missing half.

## Build

```bash
make                     # main.elf      — baremetal aarch64, for the board
make local               # main_local.elf — x86, this host
make run-local           # build the host ELF and run it
make TRACE=1             # either target, with per-layer tensor dumps
make clean               # both; clean-local for just the host artifacts
make CROSS=... CPU=...   # retarget
make -j8
```

`make` needs the Vitis cross toolchain (`source script/setup.sh
--path-set-only`); `make local` needs only the host gcc.

## Files

| file | what it is |
|---|---|
| `graph_driver.c` | one static buffer per `storage_id`, weights pointed into the blob, one call per graph node in order (@@CALLS@@ calls, @@BUFFERS@@ buffers, @@BUFBYTES@@) |
| `tvm_runtime_shim.c` | the four runtime symbols the kernels reference — a bump allocator and an error sink |
| `main.c` | entry point; feeds `input_image.h`, prints the top-5 with logits, per-phase timing, and the `device_teardown done` line `verify_host.sh` greps |
| `input_image.h` | the preprocessed photo as `static const float[@@INELEMS@@]` |
| `imagenet_labels.h` | the 1000 class names |
| `tvm_graph_types.h`, `tvm/runtime/c_*_api.h` | baremetal stand-ins, so the kernel C is used **verbatim** rather than patched |
| `weights.bin` | `resnet18_params.bin`, linked in via `ld -r -b binary` |
| `Makefile` | the build recipe — nothing is hidden in Python |
| `liblayers.a` | built: the @@LAYERS@@ per-layer objects from stage 5 — **the kernels** |
| `localobj/` | built: host objects for `make local`, kept apart from the aarch64 ones |
| `layeriohex/` | built by a `TRACE=1` **run**, not by the build: every kernel input and output as a C hex header |

`graph_driver.c` and `weights.bin` are a **matched pair**: the driver has the
blob's byte offsets baked in as literals, and `save_param_dict` orders its
output differently run to run. Never copy one over the other from a different
build — the weights land at the wrong offsets and the result is silently
garbage.

## Tracing tensors between layers — `make TRACE=1`

`graph_driver.c` carries a dump of every kernel's inputs and outputs behind
`#ifdef GRAPH_TRACE`. A normal build compiles none of it.

```bash
make local TRACE=1 run-local        # host, traced, run it
make TRACE=1                        # board ELF, traced
make local TRACE=1 TRACE_ELEMS=16   # 16 elements per tensor (default 8)
make local TRACE=1 TRACE_HEX=0      # console trace only, no layeriohex/
```

```

### Full per-layer I/O — `layeriohex/`

`TRACE=1` does two things. The lines above are the first; the second is that
**every** kernel input and output is written out *in full* as a compilable C
header of hex bytes into `layeriohex/` — relative to wherever the ELF runs, so
`make local run-local` fills `arm_build/layeriohex/`.

**Two files per call**, not one per tensor: everything a layer read goes into
`..._in.h` and everything it wrote into `..._out.h`, each tensor under its own
variable name. A conv's activation, weight and six quantization constants are
one `#include` rather than eight, and the set cannot be split up by accident.

```
layeriohex/l06_nn_contrib_conv2d_NCHWc_in.h     <- all 9 inputs
layeriohex/l06_nn_contrib_conv2d_NCHWc_out.h    <- the output
layeriohex/param_p0_weight.h                    <- by name, once (see below)
```

The **file** stem is `l<call>_<op>_<in|out>`; the **variable** prefix inside it
adds the argument slot and, for a parameter, its name and role:
`l<call>_<op>_<in|out><slot>[_<param>_<role>]`. Both are pasted straight into C
— as the include guard and as `static const … <var>_data`.

The **op slug is deliberately short** (30 chars, cut at a word boundary, with
TVM's `tvmgen_default_fused_` prefix and the trailing content hash removed).
The call index already makes the stem unique, so the op name is there to say
what the layer *does*, not to identify it — and the raw symbol is 95
characters, which made ten files in one layer look identical in `ls` with the
only difference off the right edge of the terminal. Everything that
distinguishes a file from its neighbours is now inside the first 40 characters,
and the **full symbol is still on the first line inside every file**, so
nothing is lost:

```c
/* Written by graph_driver.c under `make TRACE=1` -- regenerated every run, do not edit.
 * call [06] tvmgen_default_fused_nn_contrib_conv2d_NCHWc_subtract_add_add_subtract_fixed_point_multiply_per_ca76d0071d109ff1_
 *   -- in[1] = tensors[3] (param p0, weight, weights.bin@3895354+9408)
 */
```

Two kernels may well slug the same; that cannot collide, because the call index
disambiguates. Verified on int8 ResNet-18: **417 files** (240 in/out groups +
177 parameters) holding 446 tensors, all stems unique.

### Activations say where they came from

A layer can take **several** activations, and a bare `(in)` on each is not
enough to tell them apart. Layer 06 is the standard trap:

```
in[0] = tensors[2] (in, from call [01] layout_transform)        int8  [1,1,230,230,3]
in[2] = tensors[8] (in, from call [05] repeat_multiply_layout)  int32 [1,16,112,112,4]
out[0] = tensors[15] (out, read by call [07])                   uint8 [1,16,112,112,4]
```

`in[2]` has the **same geometry as this call's own output**, so it reads like
the conv's output fed back into itself. It is not: it is the output of call
[05], the tail of the `cast_sum -> multiply -> avg_pool2d -> repeat_multiply`
chain that starts at call [02]. That chain is qnn's **weight-zero-point
correction term** — sum the input over channels, window-sum it with the same
7x7/s2 geometry, scale by the per-output-channel kernel zero point — and the
kernel *subtracts* it, which is the `subtract` in its own fused name. The
dtypes are the giveaway: the correction is `int32`, the conv's output `uint8`.

So every activation carries its producer, `network input` if it is the image,
and every output carries its readers or `network output`. Verified: all 148
producer claims agree with the graph JSON.

### Parameters are named, not just numbered

A conv takes its activation, its weight, and five or six int32 constants. As
`_in3` / `_in4` / `_in6` those are indistinguishable, so every input that is a
graph **parameter** carries its name and its role:

| role | what it is |
|---|---|
| `weight` | the int32 MAC multiply |
| `bias` | added into the accumulator |
| `zero_point` | subtracted |
| `requant_multiplier` | the **int64**-widened multiply |
| `requant_shift` | the requantization shift |
| `copied` | only re-laid-out, no arithmetic role |
| `unused` | wired in, never referenced |

The role comes from `network_md.kernel_param_usage` / `param_role` — the same
classifier behind `network.md`'s parameter tables, so the two cannot disagree
about what a constant is for; the labels are cross-checked against it for all
41 parameter-bearing calls. It keys on the kernel's own argument slot, and
`pN` is literally `args[N]` in the generated C, so a slot indexes this list
directly. **Only a slot that is also a parameter takes a role**: the classifier
labels activations too, and layer 06's image input lands in an `add`, which
would otherwise file it as a "bias".

The provenance line also carries the blob offset, so a dumped weight is
checkable straight against `weights.bin`:

```
 * call [06] tvmgen_default_fused_nn_contrib_conv2d_NCHWc_... -- in[1]
 *   = tensors[3] (param p0, weight, weights.bin@3895354+9408)
```

```bash
dd if=weights.bin bs=1 skip=3895354 count=9408 of=ref.bin   # == the dumped bytes
```

### `param_*.h` — every constant once, by name

The `..._in.h` groups are per **call**, so a weight read by several calls
appears in each of their headers. `graph_dump_params()` is the other view: one
file per graph constant — `param_p0_weight.h`, `param_p5_requant_multiplier.h`
— deduplicated, and covering constants no traced call reads at all. These stay
one-per-file rather than merged, because a graph constant belongs to no single
layer and the merged file would be the whole 72 MB blob. It runs once, from the
top of `graph_run()`, after `graph_init()` has filled the buffers.

`TRACE_HEX_PARAMS=0` drops this set and keeps the per-call ones. It is the
expensive half: the blob is 11.9 MB and hex is ~6x, so it alone is ~72 MB.

**Bytes, not decoded elements, and on purpose.** This is the on-the-wire image
of the buffer; the element view is what `graph_dump_tensor()` prints. The
dtype and shape ride along as macros so a reader can decode it — see *Dump
elements, not bytes* below for why mixing the two readings is the standard
way to misread this data.

| knob | effect |
|---|---|
| `TRACE_HEX=0` | keep the console trace, write no headers |
| `TRACE_HEX_PARAMS=0` | drop the `param_*.h` set, keep the per-call dumps |
| `TRACE_HEX_MAX=N` | cap each file at N bytes of payload (`_TRUNCATED` is defined in the header when it bites) |
| `make clean-hex` | delete `layeriohex/` — deliberately **not** part of `clean-local`, so rebuilding does not discard a dump |

It is not small: the full int8 ResNet-18 is roughly **100 MB** of text for the
per-call dumps plus **~72 MB** for `param_*.h`, because parameters are kernel
inputs too and a weight read by several calls is dumped for each of them. They
are dumped rather than skipped because a mismatch lands in a parameter as often
as in an activation — `TRACE_HEX_MAX` is the lever when you only need the
leading bytes, and `TRACE_HEX_PARAMS=0` when you only need the activations.

#### On the board there is no filesystem

Only the hosted build gets `-DGRAPH_TRACE_HEX_FILES`. A baremetal board under
xsdb has no filesystem — the console is the only channel — so `make TRACE=1`
for the board streams the *identical* text to stdout, framed:

```
===BEGIN layeriohex/l00_..._in0.h===
...the same header text...
===END layeriohex/l00_..._in0.h===
```

Capture it and cut it back into files:

```python
from frontend.tvmrelay.arm_build import split_layeriohex
split_layeriohex("applog")            # -> ./layeriohex/*.h
```

Linking `fopen`/`mkdir` into the BSP build instead would compile and then fail
at run time, which is the worse failure. Note that a UART carries ~100 MB very
slowly — `TRACE_HEX_MAX=256` is the usual setting for a board run.

### Why not just add a `printf`

You can — `dl_code_name()`, `dl_dtype_str()` and `graph_dump_tensor()` are
`static inline` in `graph_driver.c` and always emitted, so an ad-hoc `printf`
can call them. But **this file is regenerated**, and a hand-added dump is gone
after the next `deploy_flow.py` run. `TRACE=1` is not.

### `Input tensor data type: 69632`

That is what `printf("%d", tensors[i].dtype)` prints, and it is not a type
code. `DLDataType` is a 4-byte **struct**, so passing it to `%d` is undefined
behaviour that happens to print its little-endian packing:

```c
typedef struct { uint8_t code; uint8_t bits; uint16_t lanes; } DLDataType;
value = code | (bits << 8) | (lanes << 16)
```

```
69632 = 0x00011000
          |   | +---- code  = 0x00 = 0   -> kDLInt
          |   +------ bits  = 0x10 = 16
          +---------- lanes = 0x0001 = 1        ==> int16
```

Codes: **0** `int`, **1** `uint`, **2** `float`, **4** `bfloat`. The values
this graph actually produces:

| printed | hex | dtype |
|---|---|---|
| 67584 | `0x010100` | `int8` |
| 67585 | `0x010101` | `uint8` |
| 69632 | `0x011000` | `int16` |
| 66304 | `0x010300` | `int32` |
| 73730 | `0x012002` | `float32` |

`dl_dtype_str()` prints `int16` instead. To fix an existing hand-written line:

```c
char ds[24];
printf("Input tensor data type: %s\\n", dl_dtype_str(tensors[2].dtype, ds, sizeof ds));
```

Shapes have the same trap: `shape` is `int64_t *`, so `printf("%d", shape[i])`
is also wrong — use `printf("%lld", (long long)shape[i])`.

### Dump elements, not bytes

A byte dump of an int16 tensor reads `98 ff 9e ff a9 ff`. That is
little-endian `-104, -98, -87`, and reading it as bytes is the most common way
to misread this output — it is also why `conv2dstem_image.h` and TVM's layer 0
look like different data when they are bit-identical quantization.
`graph_dump_tensor()` switches on `(code, bits)` and prints decoded values. It
clamps the count to the tensor's element count, because the zero-point
parameters are `ndim 0` / `numel 1` and dumping 8 of those would read past a
2-byte buffer.

## `make local` — the same C on x86

`main_local.elf` is the same `graph_driver.c`, the same layer sources, the
same `weights.bin` and the same `main.c`, linked for this host. It prints the
top-5 the board would, so the result is checkable without flashing anything.

It is **not** the cross build with a different `-mcpu`. The BSP paths and the
baremetal link recipe (`--specs=nosys.specs`, `--defsym end=__bss_end__`,
`-T lscript.ld`) are dropped, and two flags have to be added — both failures
point *into* `include/aie_timer.h`, not at your code:

| flag | without it |
|---|---|
| `-D__AIESIM__` | `fatal error: xtime_l.h: No such file` — the header falls through to the BSP-only branch |
| `-std=gnu11`, not `-std=c11` | `'CLOCK_MONOTONIC' undeclared` — it is POSIX, which strict ISO mode hides |
| `-lm` | the BSP supplied libm inside `-lxil`'s group |

Objects go to `localobj/`, deliberately **not** `local/`: that is the phony
target's name, and make would read `local/x.o: ... | local` as circular, drop
the order-only prerequisite, and then fail with a misleading `can't create
local/x.o: No such file or directory`.

An **AIE-offloaded build cannot be linked here** and says so up front — the
archives are aarch64 and their kernels run on the array. Re-run
`deploy_flow.py` without `--aie-offload`/`--aiegraph`.

## Where the kernels come from

By default the per-layer sources stage 5 split out: `../layers/NN_op/NN_op.c`
-> `NN_op.o` beside its source -> `liblayers.a`, so editing one operator
recompiles one translation unit. The monolithic `../resnet18.c` is the
fallback when stage 5 was skipped (`--no-split`). Exactly one of the two is
wired in; if neither resolves, `make` stops with a named error instead of a
wall of undefined `tvmgen_default_*` references.

    Python only *generates*; ``make`` does the building, so the same Makefile
    the flow used is the one a person re-runs by hand. ``run_make=False``
    emits everything and stops, which is also what happens automatically when
    the cross toolchain is absent.

    ``local=True`` additionally runs ``make local`` on the same generated
    sources, producing (and by default running) ``main_local.elf`` for this
    host. It is deliberately **independent of the cross toolchain**: the whole
    value of a local ELF is on a box that has no Vitis install, so it is built
    before the cross-toolchain gate rather than after it.

    Returns ``{"ok", "elf"|"reason", "makefile", ...}``, with the local build
    under ``["local"]``. Never raises for a missing toolchain -- a box without
    the Vitis cross compiler is a normal place to run the earlier stages.
