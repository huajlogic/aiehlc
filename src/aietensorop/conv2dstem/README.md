# conv2dstem — the ResNet-18 stem convolution on the AIE array

A fused int8 7×7/s2 convolution (3 → 64 channels, 224×224 → 112×112) running on
a mesh of AIE core tiles, plus the host-side library that stages its buffers.

It exists twice over, and that is the point:

* as a **standalone app** (`test_conv2d.cc`) that reproduces one layer of the
  compiled ResNet-18 graph and checks itself against that layer's real output;
* as a **static library** (`libconv2dstem.a`) that TVM's BYOC path calls in
  place of its own kernel when you run `deploy_flow.py --aie-offload`.

Both are built from the same `conv2dstem.cc`.

---

## Quick start

```bash
cd src/aietensorop/conv2dstem
./buildtest.sh                      # regenerate the data headers, then build
python3 script/test/apppaltest.py aout/worklocal/build/host    # run on hardware
```

Expect, on the console:

```
[conv2dstem] GOLDEN PASS 802816/802816
conv2dstem done (rc=0).
... device_teardown done
```

`GOLDEN PASS 802816/802816` means every output byte matches what TVM's own
kernel produced for the same layer. Anything else is a real failure — the
comparison is bit-exact, not approximate.

---

## The files

### `conv2dstem.cc` — the kernel and the host library

The AIE kernel (`conv2d_spatial`, launched over a mesh) **and** everything the
host does around it: allocating DMA-capable staging buffers, packing weights
into the layout the kernel indexes, scattering the image into the
channel-aligned input buffer, and copying the result back out.

It has **no `main()`**, so building it directly archives it into
`libconv2dstem.a` instead of linking an ELF (skill: **hostlibrarymode**):

```bash
source script/aiehlc.sh --aie-version 5 \
    --runtime-source-file src/aietensorop/conv2dstem/conv2dstem.cc
```

That is what the TVM BYOC path consumes. You do **not** need this for the
standalone app — `test_conv2d.cc` `#include`s the whole file.

Three public entry points, differing **only in buffer layout** — the
arithmetic is identical:

| entry | input | weights | output | used by |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `conv2d_stem()` | `int8[224,224,3]` raw | `int8[64,7,7,3]` OHWI | `uint8[112,112,64]` HWC | callers that want the library to pad |
| `conv2d_stem_prepadded()` | `int8[230,230,3]` already padded | same | same | **TVM BYOC** (`--aie-offload`) |
| `conv2d_stem_nchwc()` | `int8[230,230,3]` already padded | `int8[16,7,7,3,4]` OIHW3i4o | `uint8[16,112,112,4]` NCHW4c | **`test_conv2d.cc`** |

Plus `conv2d_stem_verify()` (on-board CPU cross-check),
`conv2d_stem_invalidate_weights()` and `conv2d_stem_release()`.

`conv2d_stem_nchwc()` speaks TVM's *packed* layouts so the app can be fed the
graph's own tensors verbatim. It is a **separate entry on purpose**: it and
`conv2d_stem_prepadded()` differ only in layout, so merging them would silently
reinterpret every weight and output byte for the offload path — which fails as
wrong pixels, not as a link error.

### `conv2dstem.h` — the library contract

Geometry macros, the `conv2dstem_qparam` struct, the entry declarations and the
error codes. Read this first; it documents each layout and the requantization
convention in detail.

### `test_conv2d.cc` — the standalone app

The **aiehlc entry file**: it owns `main()` and `#include`s `conv2dstem.cc`, so
one command produces `host.cc`, the extracted kernel and a linked ELF. (The
frontend splices `.cc` includes into the text before its rewrites run — skill
**aiehlcincludekernel**.)

It runs the deployed graph's **layer 01**,

```
01_contrib_conv2d_NCHWc_subtract_add_subtract_fixed_point_multiply_per_axi_1a1eefcf0256215e
```

on the AIE and compares against that layer's own output. So this is not a model
of the operator — it is the operator, on the real data the network carries.

What it does: decode the layer's six int32 parameter arrays into
`conv2dstem_qparam[64]` (`fold_qparams`), call `conv2d_stem_nchwc()`, then
compare all 802,816 output bytes and print one machine-readable verdict line
(`data/groundtruth.py --applog` parses it back off the console, which is the
only channel a baremetal board under xsdb has).

### `buildtest.sh` — build the app, regenerating its data first

`test_conv2d.cc`'s two data headers are **generated artifacts**, not source, so
building by hand fails on a missing `#include`. This script produces them and
then builds:

| step | what |
|---|---|
| 1 | `make clean-local && make local TRACE=1` in `worklocal/tvmrelay_deploy/arm_build` |
| 2 | run `./main_local.elf` there — it writes `layeriohex/` |
| 3 | copy `l01_…_in.h` / `_out.h` in as `conv2d_stem_in_weight.h` / `conv2d_stem_out_golden.h` |
| 4 | `source script/aiehlc.sh` on `test_conv2d.cc` |

```bash
./buildtest.sh                 # all four steps
./buildtest.sh --skip-trace    # reuse the layeriohex already on disk (1-2 are slow)
./buildtest.sh --no-aiehlc     # stop once the headers are in place
./buildtest.sh -h
```

Env: `AIE_VERSION` (default 5), `TRACE_HEX_PARAMS` (default 0 — the standalone
`param_*.h` set is ~72 MB and is not needed, because every parameter this layer
uses is already one of its own inputs).

It needs `worklocal/tvmrelay_deploy/arm_build` to exist; if it does not, run the
TVM flow once:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 src/frontend/tvmrelay/deploy_flow.py --local
```

### `parameter.h` — vestigial

The same geometry macros (`INPUT_H`, `KERNEL_H`, `OUTPUT_H`, `K`, …) that
`conv2dstem.h` already defines. **Nothing includes it** — verified by grep
across `src/` and `script/`. Do not add it to a translation unit that already
has `conv2dstem.cc`: the two spell the same values with different token
sequences, which is a macro redefinition error, not a silent duplicate.

### `data/` and `ref/`

`data/` generates the older hand-built fixture (real photo → preprocessed,
quantized, zero-point-padded image; real conv1 weights; CPU ground truth) and
holds the cross-checks against TVM's layer 0. It has its own
[README](data/README.md) — read that before touching anything in it.

`ref/` is the CPU reference used during bring-up: `stem_ref.py` (the ground
truth), `conv2dstem_x86.c` and `verify_pack.c`.

---

## The generated `*.h`

**Nothing in this table is source.** All of it is produced by tooling and
overwritten; do not hand-edit, and regenerate rather than patch.

| file | shape / dtype | size | produced by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `conv2d_stem_in_weight.h` | layer 01's **8 inputs** (see below) | ~1.0 MB | `buildtest.sh` step 3, from `layeriohex/` |
| `conv2d_stem_out_golden.h` | `uint8[1,16,112,112,4]` — the golden | ~4.8 MB | same |

Both are `layeriohex` dumps: `graph_driver.c` writes every kernel input and
output as a compilable C hex header under `make TRACE=1` (see
`worklocal/tvmrelay_deploy/arm_build/README.md`).

`conv2d_stem_in_weight.h` carries the whole layer:

| var | dtype / shape | role |
|---|---|---|
| `…_in0` | `int8[1,1,230,230,3]` | activation, already spatially padded with the **input zero-point** (−15 = uint8 113 − 128), not with zero |
| `…_in1_p0_weight` | `int8[16,1,7,7,3,4]` | weights, OIHW3i4o |
| `…_in2_p1_zero_point` | `int32[64]` | subtracted |
| `…_in3_p2_bias` | `int32[64]` | added |
| `…_in4_p3_zero_point` | `int32[64]` | subtracted — **all zero** for this model |
| `…_in5_p4_requant_multiplier` | `int32[64]` | Q31 multiplier |
| `…_in6_p5_unused` | `int32[64]` | the kernel never reads it |
| `…_in7_p6_requant_shift` | `int32[64]` | shift, applied as `shift + 31` |

The older fixture headers — `conv2dstem_image.h`, `conv2dstem_weights.h`,
`conv2dstem_golden.h`, `conv2dstem_image_tvm.h` — come from `data/*.py` and are
**not used by `test_conv2d.cc`**. See `data/README.md` if you need them.

> Generated headers are untracked but **not** `.gitignore`d, so a blanket
> `git add .` will commit ~6 MB of them. There are also stale copies inside
> `data/` from before `buildtest.sh` existed; those are not read by anything.

## How to test

### On hardware (the real check)

```bash
./buildtest.sh
python3 script/test/apppaltest.py aout/worklocal/build/host
```

Pass is `GOLDEN PASS 802816/802816` **and** `device_teardown done`. Mismatch
coordinates are printed as NCHW4c (`occ, oh, ow, ocb`, with `oc = occ*4 + ocb`),
capped at 16 lines — the cap is not cosmetic, since 802,816 lines over a UART
would blow through apppaltest's watchdog.

### On the host, without a board

The entire host-side chain — parameter decode, weight packing, output scatter —
can be checked with a plain `gcc` by extracting the real functions from
`conv2dstem.cc` and `test_conv2d.cc` by name and substituting the library's own
`scalar_conv2d_ref()` for the AIE. That separates a layout bug from a kernel
bug, which are otherwise indistinguishable in the output. Recipe in skill
**conv2dstemtvmlayer**.

### Not a regression test

`buildtest.sh` builds and flashes; it does not assert. Read the console.

## Things that silently produce wrong results

1. **A generated header in a subdirectory.** `aiehlc.sh` collects user headers
   with a *non-recursive* `*.h` glob flattened to basename, so a header left in
   `data/` parses in the frontend and then fails at cross-g++. Keep them flat in
   this directory (skill: **conv2dstemfixture**).
2. **`make local TRACE=1` without `clean-local` first.** The Makefile's objects
   do not depend on `CFLAGS`, so a previous *untraced* build is simply relinked,
   compiles none of the trace code and writes no dumps at all. `buildtest.sh`
   handles this.
3. **`aiehlc.sh` writes `aout/` relative to the current working directory**, not
   to the entry file. Run it from this directory and you get
   `src/aietensorop/conv2dstem/aout/` while an older `$REPO/aout/` sits
   untouched — so a "did it build" check can pass against a *stale* ELF.
   `buildtest.sh` pins the cwd and requires the ELF to be newer than the run.
4. **Padding with 0 instead of the zero-point.** In the quantized domain, real
   zero is the zero-point (−15 here), not integer 0. Padding with 0 injects
   ≈ +0.279 around the whole border.
5. **A non-zero second zero-point.** TVM subtracts *two* (`acc + bias − zp_a −
   zp_b`) while `conv2dstem_qparam` has one field; the fold is only exact
   because `zp_b` is identically zero for this quantization.
   `fold_qparams()` **checks this per channel and refuses** rather than
   computing wrong pixels — if it ever fires, the algebra needs redoing, not the
   check removing.
