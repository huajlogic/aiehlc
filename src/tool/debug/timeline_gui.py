"""Matplotlib GUI for the host<->AIE merged timeline (timeline.json).

Reads the JSON produced by host_aie_timeline.py (schema: meta / anchors /
fit_per_tile / lanes[{name, events:[{event,start_us,end_us,detail}]}]) and draws
a Gantt-style diagram of HORIZONTAL timelines on ONE microsecond axis:

  * one horizontal lane per model["lanes"] entry (host first, then tiles),
  * the "host" lane is a horizontal timeline of BARS between consecutive phase
    markers -- BLUE where the host is running (setup / DMA-in / DMA-out / verify)
    and GREY HATCHED where the host is idle-WAITING on the AIE (the run->wait_done
    gap that brackets XAie_CoreWaitForDone),
  * every tile event is a horizontal bar start_us..end_us, COLOURED by event
    type (ACTIVE=AIE running / LOCK_STALL / STREAM_STALL / MEMORY_STALL / other),
    so the tile's green ACTIVE bar lines up UNDER the host's waiting bar,
  * a mem-DMA lane ("tile C,R dma <dir> <ch>") draws the lock stall
    (DMA_*_STALLED_LOCK_MEM, orange) as a full-height background band and marks
    EVERY stream stall event (MM2S back-pressure / S2MM starvation, red) as its
    own full-height per-event vertical tick on top, so all occurrences are
    plotted instead of merging into a few blobs,
  * light dashed vertical guides mark the host phase boundaries across all lanes,
  * pan/zoom via matplotlib's built-in toolbar, hover for per-event detail.

Headless-safe: with no $DISPLAY (or with --save) it uses the Agg backend and
writes a PNG instead of opening a window.

# back-pressure, and stream stall (DMA_*_STREAM_BACKPRESSURE_MEM on MM2S /
# DMA_*_STREAM_STARVATION_MEM on S2MM, both canonicalising to STREAM_STALL). A
# long stream-starvation region (tens of us) therefore fills its whole span as a
# red band rather than collapsing to a single tick at its start. Stream ALSO
# keeps a per-event vertical tick overlay -- one line per event at its true start,
# confined to the stream slice -- because binning would merge its many
# nanosecond-scale bursts into a blob; the tick plots every occurrence. Band and
# ticks share the stream slice and colour, so they do not conflict. The axis is
# inverted (host on top). When several states are concurrent on the same lane --
# e.g. a BD both lock-stalled AND memory back-pressured (DMA_*_STALLED_LOCK_MEM |
# DMA_*_MEMORY_BACKPRESSURE_MEM) -- neither hides the other: the row is split
# top->bottom into one horizontal sub-band per PRESENT category, in a fixed order
# (lock on top, mem back-pressure, then stream) for a stable, readable layout.
# Full top->bottom stack order for a mem-DMA lane. All three stall states can be
# concurrent on one BD (lock-stalled AND memory-back-pressured AND stream-starved
# at once); each gets its own horizontal slice so none hides another. The split
# is PER COLUMN and adaptive: a column paints only the states active there,
# dividing the row height equally among them, so a lone state fills the full

    Splits [x_lo, x_hi] into `nbins` equal bins (one per rendered pixel column)

    the most time wins. This makes a short burst survive as its bin's dominant
    colour instead of being overpainted by an adjacent bar (the failure mode of
    per-event rectangles). Empty bins produce no segment. Adjacent bins with the
    same colour are merged into one span.

    `priority` is an optional high->low list of colour hexes that win a bin by
    *presence* rather than duration: if any priority colour has non-zero time in
    a bin, the highest-priority present one is chosen (ignoring duration); bins

    important states visible -- e.g. a port lane's brief RUNNING bursts that the
    long IDLE/STALLED background would otherwise drown out. With no `priority`
    (the default) behaviour is pure duration dominance.

    `surface_colors` is an optional set of colour hexes treated as a foreground
    surface over the rest (the "background"): in any bin where at least one
    surface colour is present, the surface colour with the most time wins
    (ignoring non-surface background colours); bins with no surface colour fall

    background, without one fixed colour always winning. `surface_colors` takes
