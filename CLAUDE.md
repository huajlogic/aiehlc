# AIEHLC Project Architecture

AIEHLC (AIE High-Level Compiler) is a compilation/deployment solution for AMD Versal AI Engine. It has **two parts**:

1. **aiehlc** — Clang-based tool that compiles C++ (AIE driver C API) into host + kernel binaries for single-kernel AIE apps.
2. **tilinglinalg** — MLIR progressive lowering pipeline that offloads a GEMM operation across multiple AIE tiles, generating host, kernel, and routing C++ code through 6 custom dialects.

Both share the AIE runtime (`include/aie_runtime.h`) and target Versal AI Core Series with pre-built PDI.

## Part 1: aiehlc (Single Kernel)

Compiles a user C++ file into a host ELF (ARM) + kernel ELF (AIE core):

```
User C++ → aiehlc (Clang AST) → AieFrontEnd (MLIR)
  → Kernel: xchesscc → xchessmk → kernel ELF (embedded in host via ld -r -b binary)
  → Host: aarch64-g++ (host.cc + aie_runtime.c + routing + kernel.o) → host ELF
```

Key runtime API: `__Runtime_device_init`, `__Runtime_load_kernel_group`, `__Runtime_launch_kernel_group`, `__Runtime_dma_bd_config`, `__Runtime_wait_event`, `__Runtime_device_teardown`.

**Entry file may `#include` its kernel.** The `__global__` kernel does not have to
sit in the file passed to `--runtime-source-file`: a thin `main.cc` may
`#include "kernel.cc"`. `inlineSourceIncludes()` (`src/llvm/aiehlc.cc`) splices
quoted `.cc`/`.cpp` includes into the text *before* the rewrites run, so the
kernel is annotated, body-guarded and launch-lowered as if written inline. The
artifact kind follows `main()`: present → ELF, absent → `lib<app>.a` (skill:
hostlibrarymode). `src/aietensorop/conv2dstem/` ships both entries over one
kernel. The splice is deliberately **opaque** (no `#line`) because kernel export
and the host `RewriteBuffer` both key off the kernel's `FileID` — see skill
**aiehlcincludekernel** before changing it.

**Build it with `src/aietensorop/conv2dstem/buildtest.sh`**, not by calling
aiehlc directly: the entry file's two data headers are *generated* artifacts
(`layeriohex` dumps) and are not committed, so the script regenerates them —
`make local TRACE=1` in `worklocal/tvmrelay_deploy/arm_build` → run
`main_local.elf` → copy `l01_..._in.h`/`_out.h` in as
`conv2d_stem_in_weight.h`/`conv2d_stem_out_golden.h` → source `aiehlc.sh`.
`--skip-trace` reuses the dumps on disk, `--no-aiehlc` stops after the copy.
Two traps it exists to handle: the Makefile's objects **don't depend on
CFLAGS**, so without a `clean-local` first a previous *untraced* build is
relinked and writes no dumps at all (silent no-op); and **`aiehlc.sh` writes its
`aout/` tree relative to the CWD**, not to the entry file, so running it from
the app directory produces `src/aietensorop/conv2dstem/aout/` while any older
`$REPO/aout/` sits there and makes a success check pass against a *stale* ELF —
the script pins the cwd and additionally requires the ELF to be newer than the
run.

**`test_conv2d.cc` runs TVM's layer 01, not a hand-built fixture.** It drives
`conv2d_stem_nchwc()` from `conv2d_stem_in_weight.h` — the `layeriohex` dump of
call [01] (`01_contrib_conv2d_NCHWc_subtract_add_subtract_fixed_point_multiply_per_axi`)
— and self-checks against that layer's own output (`conv2d_stem_out_golden.h`),
so the app reproduces an operator the deployed graph actually runs rather than a
model of it. **The kernel's arithmetic was already correct**: all 802,816 outputs
recompute exactly from these headers using the existing
`(acc + bias − zp) · mult >> (shift+31)` epilogue. Only *layout* differed, and
both conversions are host-side — the AIE core, the `GemmSpace` descriptors and
the DMA are untouched:

| | TVM layer 01 | library | bridge |
|---|---|---|---|
| input | `int8[230,230,3]`, zp-padded (**−15**, = uint8 113−128) | same | **none** — `stage_ifm_prepadded()` already widens 3→4 |
| weights | `int8[16,7,7,3,4]` OIHW3i4o | `int8[64,7,7,3]` OHWI | `stage_weights_nchwc()` |
| output | `uint8[16,112,112,4]` NCHW4c | `uint8[112,112,64]` HWC | `collect_ofm_nchwc()` |

`conv2d_stem_nchwc()` is a **new entry alongside** `conv2d_stem_prepadded()`,
which is untouched (94 insertions, 0 deletions) so `--aie-offload` is unaffected.
Two traps: TVM subtracts **two** zero-point terms (`acc + bias − zp_a − zp_b`)
while `conv2dstem_qparam` has one field — the fold is only valid because `zp_b`
and the `unused` param measure identically zero here, so `main.cc:fold_qparams()`
**checks** it per channel and refuses rather than computing wrong pixels; and the
header's `_data[]` is `unsigned char[]`, so reading the int32 params via a
`(const int32_t *)` cast is an unaligned load that faults on the A78 — assemble
the bytes (`rd_i32`). Mismatch coordinates decode as NCHW4c (`occ,oh,ow,ocb`),
not HWC. Skill: **conv2dstemtvmlayer**.

**conv2dstem runs on real data.** `src/aietensorop/conv2dstem/data/` generates
three committed-or-derived headers from a photo and the int8-quantized
ResNet-18: `conv2dstem_image.h` (`int8[230,230,4]`, already preprocessed,
quantized, **zero-point**-padded and channel-aligned — byte-for-byte
`g_ifm_pad`, so the board does no scatter), `conv2dstem_weights.h` (real conv1
weights + 64 folded qparams), and `conv2dstem_golden.h` (CPU ground truth, which
`main.cc` self-checks against and `groundtruth.py --applog` reads back; a
baremetal board under xsdb has no channel but the console). This matters: with
real weights the peak accumulator is **1,023,225**, so an int16 accumulator
wraps — the old synthetic `[-4,4]×{-1,0,1}` fixture could not show that.
`conv2dstem_image.h` and **TVM's layer 0**
(`tvmgen_default_fused_divide_round_add_clip_cast_subtract_layout_transform`) are
the *same* quantization — bit-exact over all 150,528 values — in different
representations: `−128` vs `−zp(113)` (a constant +15), int8 vs **int16** (TVM's
`98 ff` is LE int16 `−104`, not two bytes), `[230,230,4]` pre-padded vs
`[224,224,3]` unpadded. `make_image_header.py --tvm-layer0` reimplements the
kernel's two steps (`tvm_quantize_u8` → `tvm_layer0`, literals **parsed from the
generated C**, C `roundf` tie rule) and emits `conv2dstem_image_tvm.h`;
`--verify-kernel` compiles and runs the real kernel and diffs it. Skill
**conv2dstemfixture**.

Generated headers must land **flat** in the app source dir, not in `data/` —
`aiehlc.sh:532` copies user headers with a non-recursive `*.h` glob flattened to
basename and the host compile only gets `-I<worklocal>`, so a `data/` header
parses in the frontend and then fails at cross-g++. See
`src/aietensorop/conv2dstem/data/README.md` and skill **conv2dstemfixture**.

**Control-packet plane** — register access over the stream fabric instead of the host
config bus. See **[doc/controlplane.md](doc/controlplane.md)** for the full API,
encoding, and fabric layout. In brief:

| Layer | Entry points |
|-------|--------------|
| Packet encode/parse | `__Runtime_ctrl_pktize_write` / `_pktize_read`, `_parse_ctrl_hdr` / `_parse_pkt_hdr` |
| Single-target send | `__Runtime_CtrlInstance` + `_setup_routing` / `_push` / `_tct_poll`; composed by `_read_target` / `_push_target` |
| Row/broadcast fabric | `__Runtime_ctrl_plan_init` (one-shot planner, `aie_runtime_control_plan.c`), then `_row_broadcast_write` / `_row_whole_row_write` / `_row_read` / `_row_write_ack` |
| Transaction capture | `__Runtime_control_start_transaction` → `_write_pkt_commit_transaction` → `_control_push` (WRITE-only ops → broadcast/multicast packet buffer) |
| Resource reservation | `aie_runtime_resource.{c,h}` — single source of truth for slots/arbiters/msel/pkt-ids; `RT_RES_*` constants aliased by the planner's `ACR_*` |

Key invariants worth knowing before touching it:

- Completion is the **control-packet response** draining at the shim S2MM
  (`resp_words` words), not a DMA TCT token.
- The return route KEEPS each response's stream header
  (`XAIE_SS_PKT_DONOT_DROP_HEADER`); it is stripped host-side in `rt_ctrl_read_extract`.
- Forward routing arms a **uniform slot superset** on every chain tile — all columns of
  a row respond; there is no last-tile special case.
- Provenance `dir=fwd|ret` comes from the planner's `acr_op.is_ret` tag, **not** the port
  type (both fabrics use the same ports). A slot and every master pulling it must share
  a `dir`, or the debug switch-detail view silently drops the link.
- `ResourceMgr::reserveControlPlaneResources` is **opt-in** via
  `#pragma control_plan_op_control_packet`; default off.

Platforms: baremetal (`aarch64-none-elf-g++`) or Linux (`aarch64-linux-gnu-g++`).

## Part 2: tilinglinalg (Multi-Tile GEMM)

### Six Custom MLIR Dialects

| Dialect | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **routing** | Abstract tile arrays, data IO, broadcast, mesh partitioning |
| **routinghw** | Physical tiles, stream switch ports, packet flows |
| **dmap** | Logical dataflow: ports, streams, push/pull |
| **dmaphop** | Physical hops: tile-to-tile paths, DMA, buffers |
| **dfscheblueprint** | Schedule blueprint: transfer manifests, flow configs |
| **dfschedule** | Executable schedule: DMA BD, kernel launch, locks |

### High-level frontend dialect (`aiegraph`)

Sits **above** `routing` — a fused/quantized op-level graph (TVM/Relay → aiegraph
→ per-op `run_aie_pipeline`). Not part of the GEMM pass pipeline; it lowers each
op to an independent launch on the existing backend.

**Runtime op split.** The `run_aie_pipeline` backend implements only the conv2d
family (`conv_bn`, `conv_bn_relu`). The other aiegraph ops (`residual_add_relu`,
`avgpool_fc`) are **not** sent to AIE; they are emitted as bit-exact CPU C by TVM
(`target="c"`, `src/frontend/tvm/cpu_codegen.py`). Non-conv ops still build/verify/
lower in the aiegraph IR — only the emit path forks (dispatch via
`cpu_codegen.is_aie_op`). See `doc/design/tvm_frontend.md` §"CPU fallback".

| Dialect | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **aiegraph** | Fused int8 tensor ops (`conv_bn_relu`, `conv_bn`, `residual_add_relu`, `avgpool_fc`) as SSA def-use over `tensor<Nxi8>`, with per-op quant attrs + weights `SymbolRefAttr`; `func`/`yield` container. Buffer wiring is verified SSA, not string names. |

Location: `src/mlir/mlirfront/frontend/aiegraph/` (`td/`, `gen.sh`, `inc/`,
`aiegraphmanager.{h,cpp}`, `lower/AiegraphLowerDriver.{h,cpp}`, `unitest/`).
pybind: `build_aiegraph_module(ops)` (build+verify → textual IR) and
`lower_aiegraph(mlir_text)` (walk → per-launch `tensor_specs`) in
`aiebackend/aiebackend_pybind.cpp`. Python entry: `_compiler.compile_plan(..., via_aiegraph=True)`.

### PyTorch → PT2E int8 → MLIR (`src/frontend/pytorchmlir/`)

A **second model-ingest frontend**, independent of TVM: torchvision ResNet-18
**v1** → `torch.export` → PT2E int8 (`NPUQuantizer`, per-channel symmetric
weights / affine activations) → `torch_mlir.fx` → torch dialect →
linalg-on-tensors. **Scope ends at MLIR** — no aiegraph, no AIE backend.
Needs no compiled TVM, so it coexists with `tvmrelay`.

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python src/frontend/pytorchmlir/deploy_torch.py
python src/frontend/pytorchmlir/setup_torchmlir.py --verify-only
```

Verified on torch 2.10.0 / torchvision 0.25.0 / torchao 0.18.0 /
torch-mlir 20261001: 20 int8 convs + int8 fc, fp32-vs-int8 top-1 match with
identical top-5 order. Details in
**[src/frontend/pytorchmlir/README.md](src/frontend/pytorchmlir/README.md)**.

Three non-obvious things, each of which silently misleads if forgotten:

- **`0 fused *_q` is expected, not a failure.** torch-mlir registers
  `quantized_decomposed.*` as native ODS ops, but `torch-match-quantized-custom-ops`
  matches only the *unregistered* `torch.operator` spelling — so the matcher
  never fires and no `!torch.qint8` appears. int8 still reaches linalg as
  explicit `arith.extsi/subi/mulf` around `linalg.conv_2d_nchw_fchw`.
- **`--output-type tosa` needs `--per-tensor`** — TOSA marks
  `dequantize_per_channel` illegal with no lowering pattern.
- **PT2E lives in `torchao`**, not `torch.ao` (deprecated, deletion planned).
  All PT2E symbols resolve in `torch_deps.pt2e_api()`.
- Do **not** reuse `example/model/resnet18py/resnet18.py:resnet18()` here — it
  builds ResNet-18 **v2** from ONNX weights. Only `classify.preprocess` is shared.

**Each AIE layer builds its own `lib<layer>.a`.** `run_aie_pipeline` stops at
source (`host.cc`/`kernel.cc`/`routing.cc`) exposing only
`host_canonicalized(dev, t0, t1, t2)` — no device init, no allocation, no
caller, no kernel ELF. `aie_layer_lib.py` appends a generated op entry (the
counterpart of `conv2dstem.cc`'s hand-written `stem_run()`; the pipeline never
sees that file, so it cannot emit it) **into `host.cc`** — a sibling `.cc`
would be dropped, since `hostcompile.sh` compiles a fixed source set — then
runs `hostcompile.sh` in that directory to archive
`layers/NN_op/aie/build/libNN_op.a`. `arm_build` links them by wildcard
(`AIE_LAYER_LIBS`), and `partition.json` records `archive` / `archive_reason`.
They coexist with `libconv2dstem.a` despite both carrying the AIE runtime,
because `ld` pulls only members that resolve an undefined symbol. **Not yet
wired:** `graph_driver.c` still calls the CPU kernel for those layers, so the
archives link but contribute nothing.

**qnn zero-point folding is the DEFAULT (`--no-fold-qnn-zp` opts out).** A
quantized conv lowers to `term1 − term2 − term3 + term4`; `Conv2DCombineTerms`
(`tvm-0.16/src/relay/qnn/op/convolution.cc:633`) drops **term2 and term4 when the
kernel zero point is zero** — which it is for all 20 convs here, the quantizer
being *symmetric* per-channel. It did not fire, for a narrow reason: the integer
it tests is only read when `IsConstScalar(kernel_zero_point)`
(`convolution.cc:747`), and `Constant::is_scalar()` is strictly **`ndim == 0`**
(`include/tvm/relay/expr.h:80`). Per-channel quant makes the zero point a `[64]`
**tensor**, so the test fails, `dynamic_zp` is set, both zero points fall back to
`-1`, and the `else` branch emits term2 unconditionally. The elision keys on
**scalar-ness, not on the values being zero** — per-*tensor* symmetric takes the
fast path, per-*channel* symmetric misses it. term2 depends on the live input, so
`FoldConstant` cannot remove it; it lowers to a real
`cast_sum → multiply → avg_pool2d → repeat_multiply_layout_transform` chain
**per conv**. `qnn_fold_zp.fold_scalar_zero_points` rewrites an all-**equal**
(not merely all-zero) constant zero point to rank-0 before
`qnn.CanonicalizeOps`, so TVM's own elision fires. Must run before `build_c`
**and** before `partition_for_aie` — both canonicalize internally, after which
there is nothing left to fold. Measured on int8 ResNet-18: **120 → 41 kernel
calls**, 42 → 0 correction nodes, buffers 18.58 → 14.29 MB, logits bit-identical.
`kernel_scale` stays per-channel — the requantization genuinely is.

**int8 operands are the DEFAULT (`--no-pe-int8` opts out).** The quantizer emits genuine
int8 (all 11,678,912 ResNet-18 weights measure inside `[-127,127]`, 255 levels);
what widens them is **legalization**, which describes the *hardware*, not the
numbers. `Target("c")` has `keys=['cpu']`, so the Intel rule fires,
`is_fast_int8_on_intel()` is false for a C target, and
`helper_no_fast_int8_hw_legalization` casts data **and** weights to int16.
`pe_target.py` says otherwise via a target key — `Target("c -keys=pe_int8,cpu")`,
so `generic_func` picks the int8 rule while `cpu` still serves schedules and
`conv2d_alter_op`; patching `register("cpu", override=True)` works too but
retargets every x86 build in the process. The rule is TVM's own
`helper_change_dtypes_to_int8` = `x_i8 = x_u8 − 128`, `zp −= 128`, zero-point
folded into the bias by `QnnConv2DCanonicalize` — the same algebra as
conv2dstem's `+128·Σw`. Measured: output **bit-identical**, `weights.bin`
23.5 → 11.9 MB, board ELF 24.4 → 12.8 MB, against 30 → 120 graph nodes.
**ON for the AIE paths too** (it used to auto-disable there). The old guard was
that int8 renumbers `layers/` — the stem moves from **index 1 to 6** — while
`--aie-layers` selected positionally. Selection now resolves a layer to its conv
by **weight fingerprint** (`byoc.aie_annotate.weight_fingerprint`: values sorted,
cast int64, hashed), which is layout- and dtype-independent — the same weights
hash identically as int8/NCHW, int16/NCHW and int16/NCHWc — and `check_targets`
demands one Relay conv matching fingerprint *and* geometry. Keeping int8 off was
also wrong on its own terms: the AIE kernel eats int8, so int16 legalization left
the offloaded conv's operands the one thing not in the hardware's width.
`--aie-layers` **defaults to 6** and now governs **both** `--aie-offload` and
`--aiegraph`, so the two ways in target the same conv; a stale index now reports
`not a conv -- only convs offload` rather than offloading the wrong op.
`--aiegraph` used to take no selection at all — `partition_layers(records,
aie_ops, layers)` forces every layer outside the selection to CPU with
`not in the --aie-layers selection (N)` as its `partition.json` verdict, *after*
the whole graph is still lifted and verified. It still maps 0 layers under int8,
but it already did (`byoc_aie_plan.md:160`, "0/28 eligible, confirmed") —
it keys on fused *names* (`conv2d_add_relu`) that legalization renames. **Bias,
requant multiplier and shift stay int32 and must** — bias lives at the
`s_x·s_w` accumulator scale (23 bits here), the multiplier is a fixed-point
scale in `[2³⁰,2³¹)`; together 0.5% of the blob.

**`network.md` documents the compiled graph.** One generator —
`network_md.write_network_md`, pure and byte-reproducible — reached three ways:
`deploy_flow.py` stage 6 (automatic, no flag), the `network_md.py` CLI, or a
direct import. They never differ in logic, only in *what is on disk* when they
run; deploy_flow calls it after the offload/aiegraph stages so it reflects the
*final* graph. Missing `<stem>_params.bin` makes every constant reclassify as an
activation (`parameters | 0`, no `param` rows) — now warned about loudly instead
of silently. `network.md` and `graph_driver.c` both carry a `graph-sha` line;
`grep -m1 graph-sha network.md arm_build/graph_driver.c` says whether they are
the same build. It turns `resnet18_graph.json` into `worklocal/tvmrelay_deploy/network.md`:
summary, a **Mermaid** dataflow chart with residual skips as dotted edges, a
per-call layer table carrying `dtype[shape]` for every input, output **and
parameter**, a per-argument detail table, a parameter rollup by dtype, and what
buffer aliasing saves. **Parameter roles** (`weight` / `bias` / `zero-point` /
`requant multiplier` / `requant shift` / `unused`) are read out of the generated
C by `kernel_param_usage`, keyed on the kernel's **arg slot** (layer 29's graph
`p131..p136` are `p1..p6` inside the kernel) and splitting the two multiplies by
**cast width** `int32_t` vs `int64_t` — a rank-based rule calls the rank-3 dense
weight a multiplier. Indices printed are **entry indices**
(`node_row_ptr[node]+k`) so rows line up with `make TRACE=1` dumps, and layer
folders are matched by **kernel symbol** — stage 5 writes one folder per distinct
kernel while the graph makes more calls, so positional matching mislabels
everything after the first repeated kernel. **Three numbering spaces are all
called "layer 01"**: the call index (`network.md`'s `#`, and `[01]` in a
`TRACE=1` dump), the folder's `NN_` prefix (distinct kernels, first-use order),
and `--aie-layers` (the folder index *of the first build*). `layers/` also
accumulates folders across builds — `_clear_stale` keeps non-empty dirs on
purpose, so AIE `aie/` artifacts survive — so two `01_*` folders can coexist;
stage 5 names the leftovers and `manifest.json` lists them in `stale_dirs`. The
manifest is the authority, not `ls layers/`.

**Tracing between layers: `make TRACE=1`, never a hand edit.** `graph_driver.c`
carries a per-node dump of every kernel input/output behind `#ifdef GRAPH_TRACE`
(`TRACE_ELEMS=N` for width); a normal build compiles none of it. It decodes the
dtype — `DLDataType` is a 4-byte **struct**, so `printf("%d", t.dtype)` is UB that
prints `code | bits<<8 | lanes<<16`, i.e. int16 shows as `69632`, uint8 as `67585`
— and dumps **elements, not bytes** (a byte dump of int16 reads `98 ff` = `-104`).
`dl_dtype_str`/`graph_dump_tensor` are `static inline` and always emitted.

`TRACE=1` *also* writes **every kernel input and output in full** as a
compilable C hex header (`GRAPH_TRACE_HEX`), into **`layeriohex/` next to the
running ELF** — so `make local run-local` fills `arm_build/layeriohex/`.
**Two files per call, not one per tensor**: all inputs merge into
`l06_<op>_in.h` and all outputs into `l06_<op>_out.h`, each tensor under its own
variable prefix, so a conv's activation + weight + six quant constants are one
`#include` (`graph_hex_file_begin` / `_tensor` / `_file_end`;
`graph_dump_hex` = all three, for the one-per-file `param_*.h`). File stem =
`l<call>_<op>_<in|out>`; variable prefix adds the slot and, for a parameter, its
name and role — `l06_nn_contrib_conv2d_NCHWc_in1_p0_weight`. The op slug is deliberately
**short** (`_HEX_NAME_FN_CHARS` = 30, cut at a word boundary, `tvmgen_default_fused_`
prefix and trailing content hash stripped): the call index already makes the stem
unique, so the symbol is description not identity, and at full length 95 identical
characters pushed the distinguishing part off the edge of a terminal. The full
symbol stays on the first line **inside** each file. 417 files (240 in/out
groups + 177 params) holding 446 tensors, all stems unique. `graph_dump_hex` is
`static inline` — under `TRACE_HEX_PARAMS=0` nothing calls it, and a plain
`static` warns; **`-fsyntax-only` does not report `-Wunused-function`**, so the
trace flag matrix must be compiled for real (`-c`) to catch it.
Header carries `_DTYPE`/`_NDIM`/`_ELEMS`/`_BYTES` + `_shape[]` so it decodes on
its own; the payload is **bytes** (the on-the-wire buffer image) where
`graph_dump_tensor` gives elements. Knobs: `TRACE_HEX=0` off, `TRACE_HEX_MAX=N`
cap (sets `_TRUNCATED`), `make clean-hex`. ~100 MB on int8 ResNet-18 — params are
kernel inputs and are dumped per call, deliberately.

**Activations carry their producer**, because a layer can take several and a
bare `(in)` cannot tell them apart (`_dataflow`/`_flow_note`): `in, from call
[05] repeat_multiply_layout`, `in, network input`, `out, read by call [07]`.
The trap this closes: layer 06's `in[2]` is `int32[1,16,112,112,4]`, the **same
geometry as the conv's own output** (`uint8`), so it reads like a feedback edge.
It is not — it is call [05]'s output, the tail of the `cast_sum → multiply →
avg_pool2d → repeat_multiply` chain from call [02], which is qnn's
**weight-zero-point correction term** (`term2`); the kernel subtracts it, hence
the `subtract` in its fused name. Dtype is the giveaway, not shape. All 148
producer claims verified against the graph JSON.

**Parameters are named, not just numbered.** A conv's `_in3`/`_in4`/`_in6` are
indistinguishable, so every input that is a graph parameter gets
`_<name>_<role>` (`_in1_p0_weight`, `_in6_p5_requant_multiplier`) plus
`weights.bin@<off>+<n>` in the provenance, and `graph_dump_params()` writes each
constant **once** by name (`param_p0_weight.h`) — deduplicated, including ones no
call reads. `TRACE_HEX_PARAMS=0` drops that set (~72 MB). Roles come from
`network_md.kernel_param_usage`/`param_role`, the same classifier behind
`network.md`'s tables — verified to agree for all 41 parameter-bearing calls.
Two traps: `pN` is literally `args[N]` in the generated C, so a classifier slot
indexes the driver's input list directly; and **a role may only be applied to a
slot that is also a parameter** — the classifier labels activations too, and
layer 06's image input lands in an `add`, so it would file as a "bias". A slot
absent from `kernel_param_usage` means `unused`, which is a verdict, not a
missing entry — `_param_roles` fills every slot so the two cannot be confused.

**Only the hosted build gets
`-DGRAPH_TRACE_HEX_FILES`**: a baremetal board has no filesystem, so it streams
the identical text over the console between `===BEGIN layeriohex/...===` markers
and `arm_build.split_layeriohex(log)` cuts it back into byte-identical files
(verified). Linking `fopen`/`mkdir` into the BSP build would compile, then fail
at run time.

Hand edits to `graph_driver.c` are overwritten by the next `deploy_flow.py` run;
change `arm_build._trace_lines` / `_DEBUG_HELPERS_C` instead. All of it is restated in the
**generated** `arm_build/README.md` (`arm_build.write_readme` / `_README_MD`), which
carries each run's real numbers — edit the template, never the copy.

**`--local` runs the same C on x86.** `deploy_flow.py --local` (or `make local` /
`make run-local` in `arm_build/`) links `main_local.elf` from the *same* generated
sources with the host gcc and runs it, printing the same top-5 the board would, so
stage 7's onnxruntime reference is checkable without flashing a board — the flow
prints `local vs cpu: MATCH/MISMATCH`. It needs no Vitis toolchain (so it composes
with `--no-arm`, and is built *before* the cross-toolchain gate). It is **not** the
cross build retargeted: the BSP and the baremetal link recipe are dropped, and two
flags must be **added** — `-D__AIESIM__` (else `aie_timer.h` includes the BSP-only
`xtime_l.h`) and `-std=gnu11` not `-std=c11` (else POSIX `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` is
hidden *inside* that header). Objects land in `arm_build/localobj/`, never `local/`
— that is the phony target's name and make drops the order-only dir dependency as
circular. An AIE-offloaded build cannot link here and fails with a named error.
Skill: **tvmlocalhostelf**.

**The board ELF links from the per-layer split, not the monolithic C.** Stage 5
(`split_layers.py`, on by default; `--no-split` disables) writes one translation
unit per operator to `worklocal/tvmrelay_deploy/layers/NN_op/NN_op.c`; stage 6
(`arm_build.py`) compiles each to a `.o` **beside its source** and archives them
into `arm_build/liblayers.a`, which `graph_driver.c` + `main.c` link against.
Editing one operator recompiles one TU. `resnet18.c` remains the fallback when
`layers/` is absent; exactly one of the two is wired in, and `make` stops with a
named error if neither resolves. Cost measured on ResNet-18 int8: **+0.02%**
`.text`. Because every layer includes `layers_common.h`, that header now also
carries mid-file material (a BYOC prelude) and a synthesized prototype for any
function defined but not pre-declared — so **BYOC codegen must keep weights as
function-scope statics**, or they duplicate into all 65 TUs and collide at link.

### TVM `--aie-offload` → AIE via BYOC

`deploy_flow.py --aie-offload --aie-layers N` (default 1, the stem) puts layer N
on the AIE: after the CPU build, Relay `MergeComposite` → `PartitionGraph` →
`relay.ext.aie` codegen, the C is rebuilt, and TVM's graph executor calls the
generated wrapper → `conv2d_stem_prepadded()` in `aout/libconv2dstem.a` (built
from `src/aietensorop/conv2dstem/conv2dstem.cc` by `aiehlc.sh` in library mode —
skill **hostlibrarymode**; aiehlc generates the init/partition/launch caller).
`--byoc-aie` was merged into this flag. Code: `src/frontend/tvmrelay/byoc/`
(`aie_patterns`, `aie_fuse`, `aie_annotate`, `aie_codegen`, `aie_byoc`) +
`aie_offload.py`; design
**[doc/design/aie_offload_byoc.md](doc/design/aie_offload_byoc.md)**; check
`byoc/verify_aie_stem.py` (bit-exact vs TVM, incl. all 1000 logits).

**`--aie-offload` also runs the aiegraph lift** over the same `--aie-layers`
selection, because BYOC writes no per-layer artifacts. That is what puts
`layers/01_*/aie/` on disk, as `aiegraph.conv_bn` H=230 Cin=3 Cout=64 K=7 s2.
A conv with exactly that stem geometry is **not** built from the generic
placeholder body (`kernels.conv_bn_body`: int16 acc, dummy quant): `aie_stem_lib`
runs `aiehlc.sh` on `conv2dstem.cc` in a scratch cwd and installs
`aout/worklocal/` as the layer's `aie/` (`conv2d_spatial.cc`, `host.cc`,
`kernel.cc`, `routing.cc`, `build/libconv2dstem.a`). That is the logic
`test_conv2d.cc` verifies bit-exact: `kernel.cc`/`routing.cc`/bcf/prx are
byte-identical to its build, and `host.cc` is a strict subset (it lacks only
`test_conv2d.cc`'s `main()` driver). `partition.json` records `backend: aiehlc`
+ `source`. It adds ~80 s per run. It is additive (every `.c` is
untouched), so `worklocal/tvmrelay_deploy/test/run_test.sh` holds `layers/` to
the **default-flow** `layers-golden/` and checks `aie/` separately. aiegraph
used to lift 0 convs under int8 because `_conv_geometry` read 4-D only; it now
folds NCHWc through `aie_offload._layer_geometry`. Skill: **aieoffloadaiegraph**.

**Four steps, one per file, and only the first is TVM's.** `partition_for_aie` is
orchestration over **1 fuse** (`aie_fuse`: canonicalize → `MergeComposite` → tag
`aie.weight_fp`) → **2 select** (`aie_annotate`: fingerprint ∈ selection *and*
`kernel_can_run` → tag `aie.layer_id`) → **3 partition** (`MergeCompilerRegions`
→ `PartitionGraph`) → **4 codegen** (`aie_codegen`: `relay.ext.aie`, dispatched
on the composite name via `_EMITTERS`). **"Fuse" names two different things and
they cannot be reordered**: step 1 is `MergeComposite`, while TVM's `FuseOps` is
TE-level fusion and is the *last* pass of the second `relay.build`, necessarily
after partitioning so it only fuses what stayed on the CPU — "byoc before fuse"
is correct, not a bug. Fusion is deliberately **geometry-agnostic**: the stem
gate used to sit in the `MergeComposite` checker, so only the one offloadable
layer ever fused, "malformed" and "not the stem" were the same silence, and the
inline-back path was unreachable. `check_fused_qconv` is shape-only;
`kernel_can_run` is capability and returns `(ok, reason)`, which is what
separates `info["unmatched"]` (did not fuse) from `info["rejected"]` (fused,
unrunnable, with the reason). The cost: **inline-back is now hot** — ~12 convs
fuse and are inlined back per run, and the whole C is rebuilt from that module,
so `verify_aie_stem.py`'s whole-network logit check is the regression gate, not
a formality. Skill: **byocfusesplit**.

Non-obvious and each one silently wrong if broken — see skill **byocaieoffload**:
the subgraph is the **fused** op (conv → requantize → ReLU → uint8), because that
is all the AIE kernel can emit; the uint8 input (zero-point 113) goes in as
**`x − 128`** with `+128·Σw` folded into the bias — a plain cast corrupts every
pixel ≥ 128; TVM pads with the **zero-point**, so the library takes the
**pre-padded** 230×230 tensor; layers map onto Relay convs by **weight
fingerprint**, not position (shortcut convs run in a different order); the
accumulator must be **int32**; per-channel quant params hide in the filter
window's **pad channel**; kernel-visible helpers must be **macros**; and the link
needs the BSP's `libxil.a` de-duplicated against `libxaienginea78.a`.

### Pass Pipeline

**Shared stages** (produces dfscheblueprint IR, then module is cloned):

1. `RoutingUnrollingLowerPass` — unroll abstract routing into per-tile ops
2. `RoutingToDmapPass` — routing → logical dataflow
3. `DmapToDmaphopPass` — logical → physical hops
4. `DmaphopTodfscheblueprintPass` — hops → schedule blueprints

**Host path** → `host.cc`:

5. `BlueprintToSchedulePass` → `ScheduleCanonicalizePass` → (`GroupRegWritePass`, opt-in) → `DfscheduleToApiPass` → `RoutingConstantFoldPass` → `CanonicalizerPass` → EmitC → `host.cc`

`GroupRegWritePass` is **gated** on `routing.control_plan_group_reg_write`, published by
aiehlc only for `#pragma CONTROL_PLAN_GROUP_REG_WRITE`. Off (the default), per-tile lock
inits emit as individual `XAie_LockSetValue` writes instead of coalesced control-packet
group writes (`__Runtime_ctrl_row_write_ack`), and the pipeline logs
`GroupRegWritePass skipped`.

**Kernel path** → `kernel.cc`:

5. `BlueprintToScheduleKernelPass` → (`DfscheduleKernelAggregationPass`, offload-only) → `DfscheduleToKernelApiPass` → EmitC → `kernel.cc`

`DfscheduleKernelAggregationPass` (`pass/passdfschedulekernelaggregation/`, gated on
`routing.kernel_config_offload`) collapses the per-core-tile DMA config onto
`dfschedule.declaretile.self` — one BD group per window instead of one per tile
(96 → 6 `dma_bd`). `packet_id` / `out_of_order_bd_id` are **SSA operands, not
attributes**, and must stay `arith.constant`-foldable. See
**[doc/design/kernel_dma_aggregation.md](doc/design/kernel_dma_aggregation.md)** — it
covers why `declaretile.self` is its own op (fail-closed on `getDefiningOp`), why
`ooo_bd_id` needs the `ResourceMgr` singleton fallback on the kernel clone, and why
erasure must be a fixpoint sweep.

**KERNELCONFIGOFFLOAD** (gated on `routing.kernel_config_offload`, set by
`#pragma KERNELCONFIGOFFLOAD`, default off, Gen5 only): the core self-configures all of
its own core-tile DMA from `kernel.cc` via MMIO instead of the host programming it over
the config bus, using `src/mlir/runtime/aie_kernel_runtime.h` (encoders + `core_reg_*`
apply, the latter going through `kernel_tm.h`'s `TM_W` — a plain pointer cast never
reaches the processor bus). See
**[doc/design/kernel_config_offload.md](doc/design/kernel_config_offload.md)** for that
TM rule, the direction asymmetry, the cross-clone plan channel, and the BD-id reservation
contract — each one deadlocks or silently corrupts registers if broken.

**Pass layout.** Both blueprint-lowering passes live under `pass/passblueprintlowering/`, with the shared `helper/` hoisted **above** them (`passblueprintlowering/helper/`) rather than nested inside the host pass. The two paths describe the same physical core tiles — one BD bank, one lock array per tile — so whoever programs it must agree with whoever doesn't. Anything both paths must agree on belongs in `helper/`. See `passblueprintlowering/README.md`.

**Routing path** (alternative, Path A) → `routing.cc`:

1. `RoutingUnrollingLowerPass` → `RoutingLowerPass` → `RoutingHWLowerPass` → `RoutingDeadArgPass` → `RoutingConstantFoldPass` → `CanonicalizerPass` → EmitC → `routing.cc`

### Routing Implementation (`pass/routingimplement/`)

- **RoutingTopology**: Gen2 AIE tile topology model
- **RoutingPath**: BFS path finding (priority: Memory > SHIM > Core)
- **ResourceManager**: Tracks link/port usage to avoid conflicts

## Build

```bash
# Main aiehlc binary
mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. -DLLVM_INSTALL_DIR=/path/to/llvm/build && make -j$(nproc)

# TilingLinalg unitest (standalone)
 source script/aiehlc.sh --aie-version 5 --runtime-source-file ./example/tileprogram/ccode/simplematmul2.cc
 python3 ./script/test/apppaltest.py -y  -nonreboot > ./applog 2>&1
```

Each dialect has `td/` (TableGen), `gen.sh` (runs mlir-tblgen), and `inc/` (generated .inc files).

## Test and Verification

### Unitest CLI

```bash
source script/aiehlc.sh --aie-version 5 --runtime-source-file ./example/tileprogram/ccode/simplematmul.cc
```

### End-to-End Flow

```
1. Generate    source script/aiehlc.sh --aie-version 5 --runtime-source-file ./example/tileprogram/ccode/simplematmul.cc
2. HW run      python3 script/test/apppaltest.py aout/worklocal/build/host  → SSH+xsdb+console
3. Verify      script/test/verify_host.sh → pass: "device_teardown done", fail: "AIE ERROR"
```

### Per-Dialect Unit Tests

Each dialect has its own `unitest/` directory with independent CMake build:
- `routing/unitest/`, `routinghw/unitest/`
- `dataflowmap/{dmap,dmaphop,dfschedule,dfscheblueprint}/unitest/`
- `pass/routingimplement/{routing,hw}/unitest/`

**Embedded LLM plugin** (`src/tool/debug/dbg_llm_skills/`): nine skills for the browser LLM tab. Launch locally with `claude --plugin-dir src/tool/debug/dbg_llm_skills`. Listed in **debug-ui-framework** reference.

**External:** aiedbg clone at `/scratch/staff/bkirinci/aiedbg` — see plugin skill `aiedbg-reference`.

**Command:** [data-mismatch-debug](.claude/commands/data-mismatch-debug.md) — systematic DMA data-mismatch triage.

### Browser automation (MCP)

`mcp-browser` (configured in `.mcp.json`, built at `thirdparty/mcp-browser/`) gives live
Playwright browser control. **Use it for any debug-UI work** — verifying
`schedule_debug_server.py` / `schedule_view.py` renders, reproducing UI bugs, and
confirming a server-side change actually reaches the page.

Workflow: start the debug server → `browser_navigate` to `http://localhost:<port>` →
`browser_screenshot` → interact with `browser_click` / `browser_extract_text`.
Other tools: `browser_type`, `browser_wait_for_element`, `browser_execute_script`.

After changing it: `cd thirdparty/mcp-browser && npm run build`, then restart Claude Code
to reload the MCP server.

### Debug tools

- **[src/tool/debug/README.md](src/tool/debug/README.md)** — user guide and CLI for all debug tools
- **Skill: debug-ui-framework** — implementation map for `schedule_debug_server.py`, `schedule_view.py`, `aiegdb.py`, `aiemcp.py`, `aiediag.py`, `xaiehost2provenance.py` (detail in [reference.md](.cursor/skills/debug-ui-framework/reference.md))

### Build notes

- **[script/verify_env.sh](script/verify_env.sh)** — validate Vitis, LLVM, toolchain, board vars before build
- **[script/hostcompile.sh](script/hostcompile.sh)** — kernel build via `compile_one_kernel()` → `kc.sh`; do not restore deleted `compile_kernel.sh` (skill: hostcompile-entrypoint). Picks `HOST_ENTRY_KIND` from the generated `host.cc`: `int main()` / `void main()` link an ELF, **no main() archives `lib<app>.a`** instead (skill: hostlibrarymode). The `return;`→`return 0;` fixup is main-only — it rewrites the *first* `return;` in the file and corrupts `host_canonicalized` if applied without a main.
- **[script/aiehlc.sh](script/aiehlc.sh)** — `--platform sim` is build-only; launch sim separately via `runsim.sh` or debug UI **Run** (skills: sim-build-run-separation, raw-xaie-sim-debug-bundle)
- **`include/bspcompat/`** — shims for standalone-BSP headers present only on the armclang branch (`thirdparty/alib/include/` is a flattened copy of *one* BSP, picked by `--aie-version`, wiped every run, gitignored). `aiehlc.sh` appends `-I${AIEHLC_DIR}/include/bspcompat` **last** in `AIEHLC_ARGS` so the real Gen5 header still wins — add it to the **front-end only**, never to the host/kernel compiles. Details and the related `AIE_GEN > 2` XTime gate: skill **bspheadergen2**.
- **[script/kc.sh](script/kc.sh)** — after linking the kernel ELF, `strip_kernel_debug_loc` drops `.debug_loc` + the `.debug_info` group via `llvm-objcopy` (13.7 MB → 82 KB on matmul; this is JTAG download time, since the kernel ELF is embedded into the host ELF and `dow -force`d). `.debug_line` is kept, so `kernel.linemap.json` / aiediag pc are unaffected; the full-DWARF original is parked at `<out>/kernel_debug`. `--keep-debug-loc` opts out. Must be `llvm-objcopy` — GNU binutils rejects the chess `e_machine 0x108`.
