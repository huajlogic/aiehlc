# AIEHLC Project Architecture

AIEHLC (AIE High-Level Compiler) is a compilation/deployment solution for AMD Versal AI Engine. It has **two parts**:

1. **aiehlc** — Clang-based tool that compiles C++ (AIE driver C API) into host + kernel binaries for single-kernel AIE apps.
2. **tilinglinalg** — MLIR progressive lowering pipeline that offloads a GEMM operation across multiple AIE tiles, generating host, kernel, and routing C++ code through 6 custom dialects.

Both share the AIE runtime (`include/aie_runtime.h`) and target Versal AI Core Series with pre-built PDI.

## Part 1: aiehlc (Single Kernel)

Compiles a user C++ file into a host ELF (ARM) + kernel ELF (AIE core):

```
User C++ → aiehlc (Clang AST) → AieFrontEnd (MLIR)
  → Kernel: xchesscc → xchessmk → kernel ELF (embedded in host via ld -r -b binary)
  → Host: aarch64-g++ (host.cc + aie_runtime.c + routing + kernel.o) → host ELF
```

Key runtime API: `__Runtime_device_init`, `__Runtime_load_kernel_group`, `__Runtime_launch_kernel_group`, `__Runtime_dma_bd_config`, `__Runtime_wait_event`, `__Runtime_device_teardown`.

Control-packet API: `__Runtime_ctrl_pktize_write(out, cap, stream_id, tile_addr, data, nwords, lastwriteack, ret_sid, &resp_words)` (build WRITE control-packet words; when `lastwriteack` and `nwords>0`, the LAST written word is re-emitted as a single-word WRITE-WITH-RETURN access — op=0b10, return stream id [28:24] — whose header-only response acks all preceding writes, so `resp_words`=1), `__Runtime_ctrl_pktize_read(out, cap, req_sid, ret_sid, tile_addr, nwords, &resp_words)` (build READ control-packet words per doc/controlpkt.txt: op=01, byte addr [19:0], beats-1 [21:20], return stream id [28:24], odd parity [31]; no data payload; reports the expected response word count — now counting, per access, 1 stream header word + its data words, since the return-route master KEEPS each response packet's stream header via XAIE_SS_PKT_DONOT_DROP_HEADER; the per-access header is stripped host-side in `rt_ctrl_read_extract`). `__Runtime_ctrl_push(inst, buf, nwords, block, log)` pushes a packet buffer via a SHIM MM2S BD; the send context — dev, shim col, bd_id, mm2s_ch — comes from a `__Runtime_CtrlInstance *`, with `buf`/`nwords` the per-call payload; `block!=0` also waits for the response drain via `__Runtime_ctrl_tct_poll`. The return path is the **control-packet response**: the dest CTRL slave port emits the response (read data / write-with-return ack), circuit-switched down to the shim S2MM (the drain landing `resp_words` words is the completion barrier — no DMA TCT token issue). The send context is a `__Runtime_CtrlInstance` struct (shim col, dest tile, stream id, DMA channels/BD, `resp_words`, internal response buffer `token`); `__Runtime_ctrl_setup_routing(inst)` programs the shim→dest CTRL forward route + dest CTRL slave→shim S2MM return route, allocates the response buffer (`resp_words` words), and arms the shim S2MM; `__Runtime_ctrl_tct_poll(inst, print)` polls the S2MM drain and returns the first response word. `__Runtime_ctrl_read_target(dev, shim_col, dest_col, dest_row, req_sid, ret_sid, tile_addr, nwords, out_data, bd_id, mm2s_ch, s2mm_ch)` composes it all for a register read: build read packets → setup_routing → ctrl_push → tct_poll → extract data words into `out_data` (the return route keeps each response's stream header, so `rt_ctrl_read_extract` skips the per-access header word when copying out the data). Single shim S2MM drain BD ⇒ one response packet (a ≤4-word access not crossing a 128-bit boundary); larger reads need one BD per packet (not yet implemented). `__Runtime_ctrl_push_target` composes setup_routing → ctrl_push → tct_poll around one packet buffer. Two header parsers invert the pktize encoding: `__Runtime_ctrl_parse_ctrl_hdr(ctrl_hdr, &addr, &op, &beats, &ret_sid)` decodes a control-info word (addr [19:0], op [23:22] 00/01/10, beats = [21:20]+1 = 1..4, return sid [28:24]); `__Runtime_ctrl_parse_pkt_hdr(pkt_hdr, &id, &type, &src_row, &src_col)` decodes an AIE packet-switched stream header (id [4:0], type [14:12] with 7=SLVERR, source row [20:16], source col [27:21]). Any out-pointer may be NULL; both return 1 iff the odd-parity bit [31] over [30:0] is consistent. The debug provenance for a control-packet host.cc is produced statically by `xaiehost2provenance.py` (it recognizes `__Runtime_CtrlInstance` sends — shim + vertical pass-through + dest tiles and two flows per send), so `schedule_debug_server.py` can open a debug GUI without a `Work/` tree. When `__Runtime_ctrl_pmap_enable(1)` is set before the first `aie_ctrl*` `setup_routing` / `plan_init`, the `aie_ctrl*` routing setup also emits a per-port control-plan provenance map to the applog — one `CONTROLPAN-PMAP col=.. row=.. port=.. idx=.. dir=fwd|ret ms=master|slave id=.. sw=pkt|circuit slot=.. arb=.. msel=.. mask=..` line per programmed stream port (same-column climb + row fabric); `arb`/`msel`/`mask` are the AIE stream-switch packet-routing params (a packet slave slot carries mask+msel+arbiter, a packet master carries mselen(as msel)+arbiter; circuit ports and legacy lines emit/default -1 for all three via `rt_pmap_port_ex`, so old applogs stay backward compatible). `dir` comes from the planner's own `acr_op.is_ret` fabric tag (read by `rt_acr_dir`), NOT from the port type: the return chain arms its slots on CTRL/EAST **slaves** and its non-head master on WEST — all ports the forward chain also uses — so a port-based guess mislabels every non-spine return port as `fwd`. Slot/master ops derive `is_ret` from `arbiter == ACR_ARB_RET` (the two fabrics use disjoint arbiters by construction); slave-enable and circuit ops carry no arbiter, so `acr_emit_ret_slot` and the return CCT set it explicitly. **Invariant:** a slot and every master that pulls it must share a `dir`, because `tile_switch_view` buckets ports by direction *before* linking slot→master — a mismatch silently drops the link from the switch-detail view (`test_ctrl_row_plan.cpp::test_is_ret_tagging` locks this in). The pure row-control planner (`aie_runtime_control_plan.c`, host-unit-tested via `unitest/test_ctrl_row_plan.cpp` + `build_ctrl_row_plan.sh`) arms a **uniform persistent forward-slot superset** on every chain tile's ingress slave port so a single row-multicast reaches EVERY column of the target row (the governing "all columns respond" model — no per-column last-tile special casing). The 5-bit id reserves `[4]=broadcast marker`; when `[4]=0` the packet is a **row-multicast** whose `[1:0]=target row **add-order index**` (0..3, `ACR_MAX_ROW_IDX`; the Nth row in the `plan_init` list gets index N) and `[3:2]` is a legacy column-subset class field (`ACR_CLASS_*`, no longer separately routed). Every tile arms: slot0 CONSUME (pkt=`rowidx`, mask `ACR_MASK_CONSUME 0x17` ⇒ matches row K for classes 00 **and** 10, msel0)→CTRL+EAST; slot1 BCAST (`0x10`/`0x10`, msel1)→CTRL+EAST(+NORTH on head); spine-head tiles add slot2 TRANSIT_N (`0x00`/`0x10`, msel2)→NORTH climb. Per-tile masters (arb0, keep_header): CTRL `MSelEn=0x3` on **every** tile (last tiles are no longer special — the old `0x7` CTRL_LAST plus the ONLY_LAST/WHOLE/TRANSIT_E slots are gone), EAST `MSelEn=0xB` when not the last col, NORTH `MSelEn=0x6` at the head-on-spine-column. Forward slot budget: spine head=3, other tiles=2 (all ≤4). **Return chain** (`acr_plan_return_chain`, distinct arbiter `ACR_ARB_RET=1`): every target-row column injects its CTRL-slave response (RET_LOCAL slot, accept-any pkt=0/mask=0, msel0) and the responses merge **east→west** — each tile with an east neighbor also arms an EAST-slave RET_TRANSIT slot (msel1) to pull the neighbor's westbound bus; non-head tiles drive their merged bus WEST (`MSelEn` interior `0x3`, last col `0x1`), while the head (col_lo, on the spine column) drives SOUTH→VRET (`MSelEn 0x7`, also merging descending upper-spine responses via a NORTH-slave RET_NORTH slot msel2). `acr_plan_return_chain(o,b,row,col_lo,col_hi,is_top)` takes an `is_top` flag: the **topmost** configured row's return head OMITS the idle RET_NORTH slot (nothing descends from above it) and drives SOUTH→VRET with `{local, transit}` only; non-top heads keep the full `{local, transit, north}` merge. `acr_plan_row_add(...,is_top)` builds the forward chain then the return chain per row (threading `is_top`); pure pass-through spine rows emit BOTH a forward circuit `ACR_OP_CCT` (SOUTH→NORTH, class-agnostic) and a return circuit CCT (NORTH→SOUTH) so responses descend the VRET spine to the shim. `acr_plan_chain_ex(o,b,row,rowidx,col_lo,col_hi,ctrl_id,shim_col,head_ingress)` takes `int shim_col` (‑1 ⇒ plain chain, no NORTH climb); `acr_plan_row_add` passes `rowidx=s->nrows` and `shim_col=col_lo` so the head emits its own NORTH climb (bcast + transit, so any row-multicast reaches any row), and spine extension through an already-configured head row emits nothing (that head climbs itself). The fabric is now configured in one shot by `__Runtime_ctrl_plan_init(f, dev, shim_col, resp_s2mm_ch, ctrl_id, rows, nrows)` — `rows` is a `__Runtime_CtrlRowChain[]` (each `{row, col_lo, col_hi}`) ordered bottom-up; a static one-shot planner (`rt_ctrl_plan_add_rows`) computes the top row and plans/emits every chain, reusing the shared spine. `plan_init` also programs the **shim return leg** at plan time (`rt_ctrl_row_shim_return_route`: shim NORTH/VRET→SOUTH circuit + S2MM stream-port enable + provenance) whenever `resp_s2mm_ch >= 0`, so the return spine reaches the shim (row 0) up front — symmetric with the per-send forward entry (`rt_ctrl_row_shim_entry`) and visible on the device map without needing a read/write-ack send; only the response-buffer-dependent S2MM **BD arming** stays per-send inside `rt_ctrl_row_shim_return` (which re-runs the idempotent route helper). The topmost configured row's return head omits the idle `RET_NORTH` merge slot (nothing descends from above it); non-top heads still merge `{local, transit, north}` and drive `SOUTH→VRET`. The runtime send API is `__Runtime_ctrl_row_broadcast_write` (id `0x10`) + `__Runtime_ctrl_row_whole_row_write(f,row,...)` for a row-multicast write (resolves the physical `row`→add-order index via `f->rows[]`, builds `sid=(ACR_CLASS_WHOLE_ROW<<2)|rowidx`, targets `col_lo`); the legacy `__Runtime_ctrl_row_all_but_last_write` / `__Runtime_ctrl_row_only_last_write` wrappers still compile but resolve onto the same uniform superset. The **return-path** APIs are `__Runtime_ctrl_row_read(f,row,tile_addr,nwords,out_vals,bd_id,mm2s_ch)` (per-column register read: sends a whole-row read control-packet, arms `ncols` shim S2MM BDs `bd_id+1..bd_id+ncols` — one per response packet — via `rt_ctrl_row_shim_return`, polls the drain, then routes each landed packet's data into `out_vals[ci*nwords]` by parsing its kept stream-header `src_col`) and `__Runtime_ctrl_row_write_ack(f,row,tile_addr,data,nwords,bd_id,mm2s_ch)` (whole-row write whose last word is a write-with-return so every column acks; asserts all `ncols` acks drained). The unicast write/read overlay is removed. The aiedebug device-map **Load control plan** button parses it (`controlpan_pmap.py` + the `/ctrlplan/load` endpoint) and overlays the control-plan routing on the device map. After the plan is loaded, clicking a tile that carries control-plan ports renders that tile's stream-switch connection detail as a card in the right-side Info panel (`showTileSwitchDetail` in `schedule_view.py` pushes a keyed `switch:` panel card whose `wireBody` fetches the `/ctrlplan/tile` endpoint + `controlpan_pmap.tile_switch_view`; the clicked tile is amber ring-highlighted on the map) — an enlarged SVG with one section per DIRECTION (fwd/ret): merged physical slave input ports → the packet slots each arms → merged master output fan-out. `tile_switch_view` returns `{col,row,dirs:[{dir, slaves:[{port,idx,sw,id,slots:[{slot,pkt_id,mask,msel,arb}]}], masters:[{port,idx,dest,sw,id,arb,mselen}]}]}`: a physical `(port,idx)` is merged ONCE per direction (a slave arming N slots is one box carrying N slots, not N groups). Per AIE stream-switch semantics the packet-routing params live on the SLOT: each slot box is labeled `slot N · pkt_id X · mask 0xY` with an `arb·msel` sub-line; each master is sub-labeled `arb·mselen` where `mselen` is a BITMASK of accepted `msel` values (the runtime emits it in the master's `msel=` field). A slot→master link is drawn for EVERY master that pulls that slot (`m.arb==slot.arb && ((m.mselen>>slot.msel)&1)`) across all slots/slaves — so one CTRL/EAST/NORTH master fans out to whichever slots its mselen selects (legitimate multicast). Circuit slaves carry no slot and link straight to the circuit master with the matching id. Master `dest` pairs by neighbor `(port,idx,dir)` (id-agnostic, since a packet master feeds a whole neighbor slave port). **Control-packet transaction capture** (`aie_runtime.c`, host-unit-tested via `unitest/test_ctrl_txn.cpp` + `build_ctrl_txn.sh`) offers an XAie-transaction-like flow that turns WRITE-only register ops into a BROADCAST/MULTICAST control-packet word buffer, routed against a row-control fabric (`__Runtime_CtrlRowFabric`). `__Runtime_control_start_transaction(dev, fab, row)` wraps `XAie_StartTransaction(XAIE_TRANSACTION_DISABLE_AUTO_FLUSH)` so captured `XAie_Write32`/`XAie_BlockWrite32` calls never touch HW, and records the cast target into `fab->txn_row` (`row < 0` ⇒ whole-array broadcast; `row >= 0` ⇒ row-multicast to that physical row). `__Runtime_control_write_pkt_commit_transaction(dev, fab, out, out_cap, &nwords)` is **stateless w.r.t. the caller** — it reads `fab->txn_row` back, calls `XAie_ExportSerializedTransaction`, then the `rt_ctrl_txn_translate(dev, buf, sid, target_row, out, cap, &nwords, lastwriteack, ret_sid)` helper walks the serialized `XAie_TxnHeader`+ops buffer, decodes each op's `RegOff` via `dev->DevProp.RowShift/.ColShift` into `(col,row,tile_addr)`, **verifies every op is a write op** (Write32/BlockWrite32; MaskWrite32/MaskPoll/unknown are rejected), validates the tile against the cast target (`rt_ctrl_txn_check_tile`: broadcast ⇒ every op must land on a CORE tile via `XAie_GetTileTypefromLoc`; multicast ⇒ every op must land on `target_row`), and emits one WRITE control packet per op via `__Runtime_ctrl_pktize_write` stamped with the single cast stream id (`rt_ctrl_txn_cast_sid`: broadcast ⇒ `ACR_ID_BCAST` id[4]=1; multicast ⇒ `(ACR_CLASS_WHOLE_ROW<<2)|rowidx` id[4]=0, `rowidx` = the row's `plan_init` add-order index). When `lastwriteack` (commit passes 1, `ret_sid=0`) **only the LAST emitted write packet** is turned into a WRITE-WITH-RETURN (op=0b10) so a single header-only response acks the whole batch; every earlier op stays fire-and-forget (op=0b00). `MaskWrite32`/`MaskPoll`/unknown ops, tile-type mismatches, unconfigured rows, and capacity overflow all return nonzero. Output is buffer-only; `__Runtime_control_push(fab, out, nwords, bd_id, mm2s_ch, block, log)` pushes the committed buffer to HW — it reads `fab->txn_row` to resolve the diagnostic dest tile (broadcast ⇒ last-added row head + `ACR_ID_BCAST`; multicast ⇒ that row's chain `col_lo` + whole-row sid), copies `out` into a device DMA buffer (`out` may be a stack array, which `__Runtime_ctrl_push` cannot DMA), arms the shim spine entry (`rt_ctrl_row_shim_entry`), builds a `__Runtime_CtrlInstance`, and pushes via a SHIM MM2S BD. `rt_ctrl_txn_translate` takes the already-exported buffer (only a tile-type query on broadcast), so it is host-testable with a hand-built transaction + a `make_dev()` grid + a `XAie_GetTileTypefromLoc` stub; the multicast/broadcast/last-write-ack/reject paths are covered by the 9-case unit test. `example/tileprogram/ccode/ctrlrow_demo.cc::run_ctrol_trasaction` (`demo_txn_multicast_row`) is the on-HW row-multicast demo: per core row it `start`s with `row`, issues an `XAie_BlockWrite32` to a core L1 scratch on that row, `commit`s into a control-packet buffer, byte-compares it to a reference `__Runtime_ctrl_pktize_write` with the same row-multicast sid, then delivers via `__Runtime_control_push(fab, pkt, nwords, ...)` and verifies every column of the row landed the payload via `XAie_DataMemBlockRead`. `ctrlrow_demo.cc::demo_txn_multipl_row` is the **4×4 broadcast** variant: `__Runtime_ctrl_plan_init` configures 4 core rows (3..6) × cols 0..3 on one spine, a single-`XAie_BlockWrite32` transaction is `start`ed with `row=-1`, committed (yielding exactly the `ACR_ID_BCAST` packet words, byte-compared to a reference pktize), and pushed with `__Runtime_control_push(&fab, txn_pkt, txn_nw, ...)` — delivering the payload to all 16 tiles (verified per-tile with `XAie_DataMemBlockRead`). **Control-plane resource reservation table** (`aie_runtime_resource.{c,h}`, pure C, `extern "C"`-guarded so it is C++-safe; host-unit-tested via `unitest/test_ctrl_resource.cpp` + `build_ctrl_resource.sh`) is the **single source of truth** for the stream-switch resources (packet slots, arbiters, msel, 5-bit pkt-ids/masks) the control plane occupies, keyed by device gen (`rt_res_gen` GEN1/2/5) + port-type. A static table (`rt_res_table`) enumerates the forward fabric (ingress-slave WEST/SOUTH slots CONSUME rowidx 0..3 / BCAST / TRANSIT_N on arb0, masters CTRL/EAST/NORTH) and return fabric (CTRL/EAST/NORTH slave slots RET_LOCAL/RET_TRANSIT/RET_NORTH on arb1, masters WEST/SOUTH). It exposes: `__Runtime_res_port_reserved(gen,col,row,port,is_master,out,cap)` (list reserved resources on one stream port); aggregate masks `__Runtime_res_reserved_pktid_mask`/`_arbiter_mask`/`_slot_mask`; validation predicate `__Runtime_res_is_reserved(gen,port,is_master,slot,arbiter,msel,pkt_id)` (master matching is an mselen **subset** test since return masters emit mselen subsets 0x1/0x3/0x7); and `__Runtime_res_gen_from_name("Gen#")`. All numeric constants live here as `RT_RES_*` and `aie_runtime_control_plan.h` `#define`s the legacy `ACR_*` macros as aliases of them so the planner and table cannot drift; the planner's `acr_emit_slot`/`acr_emit_master` gain **opt-in** `assert(__Runtime_res_is_reserved(...))` checks under `-DACR_VALIDATE_RESERVED` (defined by `build_ctrl_row_plan.sh`, off in production — proves the planner only emits reserved resources). The MLIR compile-time `ResourceMgr::reserveControlPlaneResources(rt_res_gen)` is **opt-in** — it runs only when the user source contains `#pragma control_plan_op_control_packet` (a bare marker pragma parsed in `aiehlc.cc` → carried into the module as attr `routing.control_plan_op_control_packet = 1 : i64`; each reserve call site gates on it, default off). When enabled it is called right after each `ResourceMgr::init` and reads the table to mark reserved pkt-ids used in `pktIdPool_` (sentinel owner `kControlPlaneOwner=-2`, so `allocatePktId` never hands them out) and records `reservedArbiterMask()`/`reservedSlotMask(port,is_master)` accessors for routing/scheduling (wiring data-plane slot/arbiter picking to consult these is a follow-up). Built into `mlirtestlib` and the host link (`hostcompile.sh`/`aiehlc.sh` `RUNTIME_SRCS`).

Platforms: baremetal (`aarch64-none-elf-g++`) or Linux (`aarch64-linux-gnu-g++`).

## Part 2: tilinglinalg (Multi-Tile GEMM)

### Six Custom MLIR Dialects

| Dialect | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **routing** | Abstract tile arrays, data IO, broadcast, mesh partitioning |
| **routinghw** | Physical tiles, stream switch ports, packet flows |
| **dmap** | Logical dataflow: ports, streams, push/pull |
| **dmaphop** | Physical hops: tile-to-tile paths, DMA, buffers |
| **dfscheblueprint** | Schedule blueprint: transfer manifests, flow configs |
| **dfschedule** | Executable schedule: DMA BD, kernel launch, locks |

### Pass Pipeline

**Shared stages** (produces dfscheblueprint IR, then module is cloned):

1. `RoutingUnrollingLowerPass` — unroll abstract routing into per-tile ops
2. `RoutingToDmapPass` — routing → logical dataflow
3. `DmapToDmaphopPass` — logical → physical hops
4. `DmaphopTodfscheblueprintPass` — hops → schedule blueprints

**Host path** → `host.cc`:

5. `BlueprintToSchedulePass` → `ScheduleCanonicalizePass` → (`GroupRegWritePass`, opt-in) → `DfscheduleToApiPass` → `RoutingConstantFoldPass` → `CanonicalizerPass` → EmitC → `host.cc`

`GroupRegWritePass` is **gated** on the `routing.control_plan_group_reg_write` module attr, published by aiehlc only when the user writes `#pragma CONTROL_PLAN_GROUP_REG_WRITE`. Without it the pipeline logs `GroupRegWritePass skipped (enable with #pragma CONTROL_PLAN_GROUP_REG_WRITE)` and per-tile lock inits are emitted as individual `XAie_LockSetValue` writes instead of coalesced control-packet group writes (`__Runtime_ctrl_row_write_ack`).

**Kernel path** → `kernel.cc`:

5. `BlueprintToScheduleKernelPass` → `DfscheduleToKernelApiPass` → EmitC → `kernel.cc`

**KERNELCONFIGOFFLOAD** (gated on `routing.kernel_config_offload`, set by `#pragma KERNELCONFIGOFFLOAD`, default off): when on, the core self-configures **all of its own core-tile DMA** — BD chains, lock inits, lock config and channel starts, in **both** directions — from `kernel.cc` via raw MMIO instead of the host programming it over the config bus, using the `include/aie_kernel_config.h` encoders (`aie_kc_encode_bd` / `_lock` / `_s2mm_start` / `_mm2s_start`). Gen5 (AIE2PS) only. The kernel include path needs `-I include` (in `script/kc.sh`).

**Pass layout.** Both blueprint-lowering passes live under `pass/passblueprintlowering/`, with the shared `helper/` hoisted **above** them (`passblueprintlowering/helper/`) rather than nested inside the host pass. The two paths describe the same physical core tiles — one BD bank, one lock array per tile — so whoever programs it must agree with whoever doesn't. Anything both paths must agree on belongs in `helper/`. See `passblueprintlowering/README.md`.

**Why the two directions differ.** There is exactly one `kernel.cc` / one ELF broadcast to every core tile. S2MM config is *identical* on all tiles (circuit-switched: no packet id, no out-of-order bd), so it emits straight-line. MM2S is *not*: `packet_id` is `basePacketId + tileIndex` and `ooo_bd_id` comes from **shim-side** BD allocation, both distinct per tile. MM2S therefore emits inside a `get_coreid()`-keyed dispatch (`col = id>>16`, `row = id & 0x1F`), one arm per tile.

**Cross-clone channel.** The host and kernel passes run on separate `module->clone()`s, so the kernel pass cannot see what the host computed — and `ooo_bd_id` is not recomputable on the kernel clone at all. The host publishes a per-tile plan through the `ResourceMgr::instance()` **singleton** (`coreOffloadPlan()` / `addCoreOffloadTile`, `CoreOffloadTileConfig`), the same channel `coreMemAllocator` already uses. **Note:** `BlueprintToSchedulePass` also holds its *own* pass-local `ResourceMgr` for BD/lock allocation — writing the plan there would strand it. `BlueprintToScheduleKernelPass::attachCoreOffloadPlan` copies the plan onto the `KernelModuleOp` as the `dfschedule.core_offload_plan` array attr, so it is visible in the `ir/*.mlir` dumps.

The gate is read **once**, in `BlueprintToScheduleKernelPass::runOnOperation` — cached alongside the tiling scalars before `applyPartialConversion` can strip module attrs. That pass owns the decision *and* the resources it implies: core-tile BD ids from `KernelResourceManager::allocateCoreWindowBdId` (a counter distinct from the per-flow `allocateBdId`; inputs are numbered first from 0, then outputs continue the same counter so the two never alias), and the 48+N kernel-intrinsic lock ids converted to 0..15 **hardware** indices (`toHardwareLockId`). It stamps `dfschedule.kernel_config_offload` plus `ping_bd_id` / `pong_bd_id` / `acquire_lock_hw_id` / `release_lock_hw_id` on **both** input and output `window_def`s.

`DfscheduleToKernelApiPass` then only **formats**: `convertMainToEmitC` reads the gate off the `KernelModuleOp` it operates on, and `emitCoreDmaConfigBlocks` reads the BD/lock ids off `window_def` and the per-tile facts off the plan attr. `emitWindowBdAndLocks` is shared by both directions. All return `LogicalResult`: a missing BD id, a hardware lock id outside 0..15, or an MM2S window with no per-tile plan entries fails the build rather than emitting MMIO writes to unrelated registers (`aie_kc_encode_lock` addresses `LOCK0_VALUE + id*0x10`, valid only through LOCK15, and the BD `LOCK_ACQ_ID`/`LOCK_REL_ID` fields are 4 bits wide — a 48 there would run past the lock array into `LOCKS_EVENT_SELECTION` and silently truncate). `window_init()` still takes the intrinsic macro names. BD base+len come from the core's own C buffer symbols (`(uintptr_t)buf_in_ping_0`, `sizeof(...)`).

**Lock direction asymmetry** (mirrors the host exactly — swapping it deadlocks): for S2MM the DMA acquires the window ACQ lock (init = ppdepth) and releases REL (init 0). For MM2S the BD's acquire/release are swapped, and it is the *release* lock (the kernel's acquire lock) that is initialized to ppdepth while the DMA's acquire lock stays at 0 — the DMA must wait for the kernel to produce.

**BD-id agreement.** Two allocators cover one physical BD bank: `KernelResourceManager` on the kernel clone and `ResourceMgr::allocateTileBd` (first-free from 0) on the host clone. They stay disjoint because the host **reserves** what it no longer emits — `reserveOffloadedCoreBds` (`helper/flowtransfer_kernel.cpp`) allocates-and-discards the BDs the core self-programs, so a host-programmed flow on the same tile is never handed one. Its count must mirror the kernel's per-window claim (2 per window, unconditionally — a single-buffer window still burns its pong slot); keep the two in step if either side's BD shape changes.

**Routing path** (alternative, Path A) → `routing.cc`:

1. `RoutingUnrollingLowerPass` → `RoutingLowerPass` → `RoutingHWLowerPass` → `RoutingDeadArgPass` → `RoutingConstantFoldPass` → `CanonicalizerPass` → EmitC → `routing.cc`

### Routing Implementation (`pass/routingimplement/`)

- **RoutingTopology**: Gen2 AIE tile topology model
- **RoutingPath**: BFS path finding (priority: Memory > SHIM > Core)
- **ResourceManager**: Tracks link/port usage to avoid conflicts

## Build

```bash
# Main aiehlc binary
mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. -DLLVM_INSTALL_DIR=/path/to/llvm/build && make -j$(nproc)

# TilingLinalg unitest (standalone)
 source script/aiehlc.sh --aie-version 5 --runtime-source-file ./example/tileprogram/ccode/simplematmul2.cc
 python3 ./script/test/apppaltest.py -y  -nonreboot > ./applog 2>&1
```

Each dialect has `td/` (TableGen), `gen.sh` (runs mlir-tblgen), and `inc/` (generated .inc files).

## Test and Verification

### Unitest CLI

```bash
source script/aiehlc.sh --aie-version 5 --runtime-source-file ./example/tileprogram/ccode/simplematmul.cc
```

### End-to-End Flow

```
1. Generate    source script/aiehlc.sh --aie-version 5 --runtime-source-file ./example/tileprogram/ccode/simplematmul.cc
2. HW run      python3 script/test/apppaltest.py aout/worklocal/build/host  → SSH+xsdb+console
3. Verify      script/test/verify_host.sh → pass: "device_teardown done", fail: "AIE ERROR"
```

### Per-Dialect Unit Tests

Each dialect has its own `unitest/` directory with independent CMake build:
- `routing/unitest/`, `routinghw/unitest/`
- `dataflowmap/{dmap,dmaphop,dfschedule,dfscheblueprint}/unitest/`
- `pass/routingimplement/{routing,hw}/unitest/`

**Command:** [data-mismatch-debug](.claude/commands/data-mismatch-debug.md) — systematic DMA data-mismatch triage.

### Browser automation (MCP)

`mcp-browser` is configured in `.mcp.json` (built at `thirdparty/mcp-browser/`). It gives Claude live Playwright-based browser control via MCP tools.

**When to use it:**
- Testing or verifying the debug UI (`schedule_debug_server.py` / `schedule_view.py`) in a real browser
- Reproducing UI bugs: navigate to the UI, screenshot, inspect element state
- Adding or debugging frontend features: navigate → interact → screenshot to confirm the feature works
- Checking that a server-side change is reflected in the rendered page without manual intervention

**Key tools:** `browser_navigate`, `browser_screenshot`, `browser_click`, `browser_type`, `browser_extract_text`, `browser_wait_for_element`, `browser_execute_script`

**Typical debug UI workflow:**
1. Ensure the debug server is running (e.g., `python3 src/tool/debug/schedule_debug_server.py ...`)
2. `browser_navigate` to `http://localhost:<port>`
3. `browser_screenshot` to see current state
4. Interact and verify with `browser_click` / `browser_extract_text`

**Re-building after changes:**
```bash
cd thirdparty/mcp-browser && npm run build
```
Restart Claude Code (or reload MCP) to pick up the rebuilt server.

### Debug tools

- **[src/tool/debug/README.md](src/tool/debug/README.md)** — user guide and CLI for all debug tools
- **Skill: debug-ui-framework** — implementation map for `schedule_debug_server.py`, `schedule_view.py`, `aiegdb.py`, `aiemcp.py`, `aiediag.py`, `xaiehost2provenance.py` (detail in [reference.md](.cursor/skills/debug-ui-framework/reference.md))

### Build notes

- **[script/verify_env.sh](script/verify_env.sh)** — validate Vitis, LLVM, toolchain, board vars before build
- **[script/hostcompile.sh](script/hostcompile.sh)** — kernel build via `compile_one_kernel()` → `kc.sh`; do not restore deleted `compile_kernel.sh` (skill: hostcompile-entrypoint)
- **[script/aiehlc.sh](script/aiehlc.sh)** — `--platform sim` is build-only; launch sim separately via `runsim.sh` or debug UI **Run** (skills: sim-build-run-separation, raw-xaie-sim-debug-bundle)
