# AIEHLC

App Writing and Deployment Tutorial: [tutorial.md](tutorial/tutorial.md)

## What is the aiehlc?

AIEHLC(AIE high‑level compiler) is a lightweight, efficient high level compilation integration solution for AIE (AI Engine) applications on Versal AI Core Series. It integrates with pre-built hardware designs (PDI) to effectively decouple hardware and software application development, providing a comprehensive end-to-end deployment solution.

Key features:

> Integrate and Support the [Synopsys](https://www.synopsys.com/) chess compiler (from the [Vitis](https://www.amd.com/en/products/software/adaptive-socs-and-fpgas/vitis.html) package) for kernel code compilation

> It Also Integrate and Supports the opensource [LLVM-AIE](https://github.com/Xilinx/llvm-aie) compiler solution for kernel compilation

> Simplifies the AIE application development learning curve for rapid prototyping


AIEHLC empowers users to develop straightforward AIE applications using only the AIE driver C API, eliminating the need to learn additional domain-specific languages (DSLs). This streamlined approach target to accelerates the development process and reduces barriers to entry for AIE application development.

### Architecture

![architecture diagram](doc/diagram/architecture.png)

### What it is Not

1. It serves as a complementary solution and is not intended to replace the official AIE software application compilation tools.
2. It focuses solely on software compilation and does not function as a hardware design compilation tool.
3. It currently supports only Versal AI Core Series devices and does not provide compatibility with Ryzen AI SOCs.

### What are the Limitations

Its primary goal is to help system engineers simplify the learning curve for AIE application development and enable quick prototyping. As a result, it may not be as feature-complete as the official tools available.

### What are the Trade-Offs

1. The pre-built PDI (hardware design) supports only GMIO interfaces. For PLIO (FPGA) support, users must implement a customized hardware design with the appropriate PLIO logic components.

2. The pre-built hardware design (PDI) delivers adequate performance for most applications. However, for use cases requiring optimal Network-on-Chip (NOC) performance, the official Vitis hardware/software tools are recommended.

3. Users must configure routing at runtime. For Ahead-of-Time (AOT) routing support, it is recommended to utilize Vitis or AIECompiler tools instead.


## Examples

```bash
source script/setup.sh
#or
source ./script/setup.sh --bsp-use-git-repo=https://path/to/aie-rt.git

source script/aiehlc.sh --runtime-source-file example/perf/aieml_perf.cc 
```

Using llvm-aie (experimental):

```bash
source script/setup.sh
#or
source ./script/setup.sh --bsp-use-git-repo=https://path/to/aie-rt.git

source script/aiehlc.sh --use-llvm-aie --runtime-source-file example/other/multikernel.cc
```

AIE2PS Compilation Support

```bash
source script/setup.sh
#or
source ./script/setup.sh --bsp-use-git-repo=https://path/to/aie-rt.git

source script/aiehlc.sh --aie-version 5 --runtime-source-file example/perf/aieml_perf.cc
```

PetaLinux Support

```bash
source script/setup.sh
#or
source ./script/setup.sh --bsp-use-git-repo=https://path/to/aie-rt.git

source script/aiehlc.sh --platform linux --aie-version 2 --runtime-source-file tutorial/example.cpp
```

## Compiling aiehlc (Optional)

Building aiehlc is only necessary if you intend to develop or compile aiehlc itself. If your aim is simply to use aiehlc, this step is not required.
